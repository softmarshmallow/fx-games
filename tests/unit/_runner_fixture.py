"""A synthetic two-genre package: the committed bellweather platformer plus a
runner member authored entirely in tmp, sharing the cover reference by digest.

Every runner member here is fixture-authored. Bellweather carried a committed
runner member while the genre was being built, and it was retired once Iron
Petal became the canonical runner game - so these tests no longer mirror a
committed closure, they construct the one they mean to test. That is the
better arrangement anyway: a refusal test that depends on a real package's
authoring choices fails for two reasons at once.

The default chunks are compliant with the full `reaction_fair_v1` placement
discipline - apron, separations, landing clearance, press windows, telegraph
arcs - so each refusal test violates exactly one rule on top of a passing
baseline. The arc pickup rows below were computed from the SDK's own
closed forms (launch surface 5, offsets 1..4 of the declared arc).
