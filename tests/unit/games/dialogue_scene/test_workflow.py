"""The Grain's scene builder through FX, offline: the plan, whole runs, the judges, reuse.

Each run builds the small two-actor package from ``package.py`` inside a scratch copy of the
game's FX project. Paid calls are answered by the stand-ins in ``tests.unit.games._grain``.
The build is documented in ``godot/games/the_grain/docs/dialogue-scene-assets.md``.
