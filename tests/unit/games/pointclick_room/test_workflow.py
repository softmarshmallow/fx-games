"""The Grain's room builder through FX, offline: the plan, a whole run, the judges, reuse.

Each run builds a copy of the shipped window room inside a scratch copy of the game's FX
project. Paid calls are answered by the stand-ins in ``tests.unit.games._grain``.
The build is documented in ``godot/games/the_grain/docs/pointclick-room.md``.
