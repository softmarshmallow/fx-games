"""Ember Hollow's builder through FX, offline: the scope ladder, whole builds, takes, reuse.

Each run builds a copy of the shipped package inside a scratch copy of the game's FX
project, with its auditioned takes struck so every asset is drawn. Paid calls are answered
by the stand-ins in ``_ember.py``. The build is documented in
``godot/games/ember_hollow/docs/generation-v1.md``.
