"""`case.json`: the join between authored members and generated runs.

The authored case names `scenarios/e1_office.toml`; the consumer plays
`out/the-grain-scene-01`. Neither side can derive the other - a run tag does not
exist until its leaf has been generated - so the mapping is supplied once, here,
and checked as a set equality in both directions like every other closure.
