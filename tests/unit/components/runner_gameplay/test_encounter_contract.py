"""The encounter block, the thrust locomotion, and the three proofs they carry.

`runner-gameplay-v4` adds the first locomotion the genre can wear that is not
running, and the first actor that can act back. Both arrive under the same
discipline the arc proofs already hold the track to: every number a refusal
reads is declared in the SDK table, and the proof is closed form, offline, and
provable before any spend.

These tests hold the contract half - the obligations between an encounter and
the things it requires, and the arithmetic itself at the numbers Iron Petal
authors, together with the neighbouring values that refuse.
