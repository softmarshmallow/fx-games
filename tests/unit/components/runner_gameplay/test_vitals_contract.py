"""The vitals gauge and the per-source consequence table.

`runner-gameplay-v3` split what v2's `collision_policy` conflated: the torso box
admission proves, and what a contact costs. These tests hold the second half —
the closed vocabularies, the obligation between a gauge and something that can
spend it, and the fact that no damage source is silently defaulted.
