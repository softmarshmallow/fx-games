"""How densely a clip is sampled for whoever judges it.

Sampling belongs to clips rather than to the shell, because two readers of one file -
the pipeline's reviewer and the standalone inspect command run before a take is adopted
- have to be shown the same frames or their verdicts are about different pictures.
