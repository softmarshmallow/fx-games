"""Each workflow's contract.md carries the checked shape of its offline sample plan.

The blocks live in src/fx_games/workflows/character_3d/contract.md,
src/fx_games/workflows/looping_parallax/contract.md,
src/fx_games/workflows/movie_sprite/contract.md,
src/fx_games/workflows/portrait_motion/contract.md and
src/fx_games/workflows/universe/contract.md. The universe
vocabulary they implement is ratified in docs/spec/universe/taxonomy-v0.md, which links the
universe contract. `scripts/write_workflow_contracts.py --write` regenerates every block.
