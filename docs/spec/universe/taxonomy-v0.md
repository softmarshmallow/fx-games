## Purpose

A universe-oriented package exists to make a storyworld understandable and
engaging through entity concept art, structured text, relationships, and
narrative entry points. It is not a game package with gameplay removed. A
universe may be organized around a continent, galaxy, city, building, vehicle,
institution, historical rupture, ecological cycle, or another coherent subject.

Franchise-specific browsing categories are useful presentation choices, but
they are not stable ontology roots. A science-fiction universe may expose
`planets`, `droids`, and `vehicles`; a magical-school universe may expose
`houses`, `spells`, and `artifacts`; a universe contained inside one building
may expose `sectors`, `departments`, and `anomalous objects`. The authored core
MUST remain valid when any one of those collections is absent.

V0 therefore separates five concerns:

1. **entities** state what exists;
2. **relationships and roles** state how subjects participate in the world;
3. **entity concept assets** establish what each entity looks and feels like;
4. **text explanations** state exact facts, relationships, chronology, systems,
   uncertainty, and rationale; and
5. **engagement projections** arrange those records for a particular genre and
   audience experience without becoming canonical universe media.

## Conceptual source inputs

The first universe-expansion workflow receives three distinct required source
roles. A future serialized contract MAY store their values inline or by
digest-bound reference, but it MUST preserve their roles rather than flatten
them into one undifferentiated prompt.

### Poster

The **poster** is one static visual source: movie poster, key art, cover,
one-sheet, or another image that establishes visual evidence and an initial
design grammar. It is neither an exhaustive world model nor automatic proof of
every depicted detail. Promotional typography, performer likeness, layout,
and marketing composition MUST NOT silently become storyworld canon.

A future executable contract MUST bind the exact source bytes and record the
rights basis for using the image as a reference.

### Synopsis

The **synopsis** is the explicit textual account of the premise, subjects,
conflicts, setting, and present state supplied by the author. Its claims are
source facts unless they are internally contradictory or explicitly marked as
uncertain, disputed, or perspectival.

### Expansion direction

The **expansion direction** is an instruction about how the universe should be
ratified or expanded: its desired scope, emphasis, depth, omissions, audience
entry, and acceptable degree of invention. It is not itself a description of
the world. It MAY request, for example, deeper institutions, a building-scale
explanation, or preservation of mystery. It MUST NOT silently override a
source fact; an intentional reinterpretation or divergence must be exposed as
such.

### Source authority and lineage

Ratification MUST reconcile the three inputs without confusing their
authority. Accepted claims MUST distinguish at least:

- authored facts stated by the synopsis;
- literal visual observations supported by the poster;
- conservative inferences needed to connect supplied evidence; and
- generated extensions admitted because they satisfy the expansion direction.

Unresolved conflicts between sources MUST remain visible for review. The
poster supplies visual evidence and grammar, the synopsis supplies explicit
world claims, and the expansion direction controls the transformation. None of
the three is permission to hide unsupported assumptions.

Source-evidence bindings and expansion rationale are distinct. A direction
requirement MAY justify admitting a generated extension, but it MUST NOT be
recorded as factual evidence that the extension already existed in the poster
or synopsis. Display summaries, audience viewpoints, and asset descriptions
MUST bind to lineaged canonical facts rather than becoming an untracked second
place to invent canon.

## Conceptual target outputs

A successful universe-expansion workflow produces one coherent package with
four connected output roles:

1. an **expanded universe document** containing the premise, viewpoints,
   present state, canonical entities, and the facts needed to explain them;
2. a **structured relational graph record** containing stable entity identities
   and typed, scoped relationships, including perspective or temporal
   qualification when needed; this role is text or structured data, never a
   rendered graph image;
3. an **entity concept asset set** containing one concept image for each
   canonical entity, with each image bound to that entity and to the limited
   facts it can honestly make visible;
   and
4. a **ratification record** exposing source lineage, generated extensions,
   unresolved questions, validation findings, coverage decisions, and
   revision identity.

The physical canonical package is a closed inventory. Its complete visual set
MUST be the enumerated entity concept image references: exactly one raster image
for every admitted entity and no other raster, vector, PDF, video, or rendered
visual artifact. Every other canonical artifact MUST be text or structured
data. A concrete projection MUST enumerate the exact allowed image references;
the current `the_weight_of_air` projection enumerates exactly 28. Its approved
source poster and any visual review proxies are generation inputs or review
instruments outside the canonical package, never additional package images.

Output cardinality is intentionally irregular. A universe MAY contain no
vehicles, many rooms, one central event, several overlapping place layers, or
hundreds of actor-to-collective relationships. Neither generation nor a
generic consumer may require empty franchise-shaped categories to make the
package look regular.

The structured relational graph record is semantic storyworld text or data and
MAY contain cycles. It is not a rendered diagram and is not the acyclic
execution graph used to schedule generation work. An asset record is connected
to the graph through stable subject and relationship identities; a file path or
gallery position is not semantic identity.

"Ratified" means admitted as coherent authored meaning. It does not mean that
generated media has passed semantic review, been accepted for publication, or
been activated by a public consumer.

## Ownership and input boundary

Universe inputs belong to their caller or to an example beside the independent
universe recipe. They do not live in the games collection unless a particular
game explicitly chooses to consume them. The executable workflow takes its own
inputs (an `inputs.yaml` naming the poster, synopsis and direction); the format is
independent of prepared `game.toml` closures.

The universe contract will own semantic subjects, entity concept images, and
text-explanation requirements. A future consumer will own browsing, layout,
interaction, and presentation. The generic engine, Grida FX, owns execution
mechanics only; it MUST NOT acquire storyworld, genre, or universe-taxonomy
semantics.

This storyworld taxonomy is also distinct from the existing
[asset taxonomy](../asset-taxonomy.md), which names executable module and node
types by asset space, camera, genre, and module. An entity class such as
`place` is authored meaning; it is not itself a node `type_id`. A future recipe
may fan one place into several typed generation and validation nodes without
collapsing those two namespaces.

## Normative language

The words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** below are normative for
future universe contract, recipe, and consumer design. They do not change
current runtime behavior.

## Model overview

```text
universe
├── identity and premise
├── audience viewpoints
├── entities
│   ├── actors
│   ├── collectives
│   ├── places
│   ├── things
│   ├── kinds
│   ├── systems
│   ├── events
│   └── ideas
├── relationships
│   ├── spatial

│   ├── material and functional
│   ├── taxonomic
│   ├── causal and historical
│   └── symbolic
├── identity markers
├── narrative roles
├── entity concept assets
└── engagement projections
```

Each branch is independently extensible. A genre profile MAY add narrower
vocabulary and obligations, but it MUST declare how each addition relates to
the V0 model.

## Canonical entity classes

### Actor

An **actor** is an individual subject capable of action, intention, experience,
or viewpoint within the storyworld.

Actors include people, named creatures, droids with agency, artificial
intelligences, spirits, and sentient artifacts. An actor need not be human,
biological, playable, heroic, or fully autonomous.

A generic creature species is not an actor; it is a `kind`. A named member of
that species MAY be an actor. A non-agent machine is a `thing`, even when it
resembles an actor.

### Collective

A **collective** is a plurality of actors with a shared identity, authority,
purpose, membership, or capacity for coordinated action.

Collectives include nations, houses, clans, factions, companies, religions,
crews, schools, institutions, orders, and political movements. A population
kind does not automatically form one collective: a species is a `kind`, while
a civilization, diaspora, government, or organization formed by its members is
a `collective`.

### Place

A **place** is a locus that can contain subjects, be entered or observed, and
participate in spatial relationships.

Places include realms, planets, regions, cities, settlements, buildings,
rooms, vehicle interiors, dream-spaces, and overlapping dimensions. V0 does
not prescribe a physical subdivision ladder. `planet`, `district`, `floor`,
and `carriage` are domain-specific place kinds, not universal hierarchy levels.

### Thing

A **thing** is a bounded material or informational subject whose identity is
meaningful to the universe.

Things include artifacts, resources, weapons, vehicles, machines, garments,
food, documents, works of art, currencies, substances, and tools. Natural and
manufactured subjects both qualify. A thing MAY also carry a `place` facet when
it contains meaningful locations, or an `actor` facet when it possesses agency.

### Kind

A **kind** is a reusable category whose members share world-significant traits.

Kinds include species, creature types, plant kinds, droid models, vehicle
classes, artifact classes, and other classifications whose common properties
must be explained. A kind is not a substitute for a collective: shared anatomy
or manufacture does not imply shared government, membership, or intent.

### System

A **system** is a repeatable rule, process, infrastructure, or circulation that
causes recognizable consequences in the world.

Systems include magic, ecology, climate, economy, law, transportation,
technology, bureaucracy, education, resource circulation, and ritual practice.
A system MUST be connected to at least one actor, collective, place, thing,
kind, event, or idea that visibly demonstrates its operation.

### Event

An **event** is a bounded change in time that alters the state or interpretation
of the universe.

Events include foundings, wars, migrations, discoveries, catastrophes,
successions, inventions, disappearances, and revelations. An event MUST record
what participated and what changed; a date without consequence is chronology,
not a sufficient universe event.

### Idea

An **idea** is a belief, doctrine, value, prophecy, taboo, law, interpretation,
or other meaning-bearing subject that influences the world.

Ideas include codes of honor, religious beliefs, political doctrines,
scientific theories, blood ideologies, prophecies, public myths, and forbidden
knowledge. An idea MUST be connected to actors or collectives that hold,
contest, enforce, embody, or suffer from it.

## Primary class and additional facets

Entity classes are semantic facets rather than mutually exclusive content
folders. Each entity MUST declare one primary class for identity, indexing, and
default asset obligations. It MAY declare additional facets when those facets
materially change how the subject must be explained.

Examples:

| Subject | Primary class | Additional facet | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A freighter used as the crew's home | `thing` | `place` | Needs both object and interior-orientation coverage |
| A sentient starship | `actor` | `thing`, `place` | Needs identity, function, and inhabited-space coverage |
| A named magical sword with agency | `actor` | `thing` | Needs character and artifact relationships |
| A nation-state | `collective` | `place` only when territory is identical to its identity | Government and territory remain distinguishable |
| A droid model | `kind` | — | Individual droids remain separate actors or things |

Facets MUST NOT duplicate one subject into disconnected records. They add
obligations and relationships to one durable identity.

## Audience viewpoint

`player` is not a V0 entity class. The more general invariant is an **audience
viewpoint**: the declared entry through which a person first encounters the
universe.

A viewpoint MAY be anchored to any major entity or question:

- an actor whose experience introduces the world;
- a place the audience enters or surveys;
- a collective whose conflict organizes discovery;
- an event whose causes and consequences reveal the present;
- a thing whose ownership or journey crosses the universe; or
- a mystery whose evidence links otherwise separate subjects.

A viewpoint states what is initially known, what scale is visible, and which
questions lead deeper. A playable consumer MAY bind an actor viewpoint to a
player role, but the universe ontology MUST NOT assume control, simulation, or
gameplay.

Every universe MUST declare at least one audience viewpoint. It SHOULD declare
several when different entry paths explain materially different aspects of the
same world.

## Place topology

V0 standardizes spatial relationships rather than physical subdivision names.
Places MAY form trees, graphs, overlapping layers, or mobile containment.

The initial universal spatial relationships are:

| Relationship | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `contains` / `located_in` | Part-whole spatial containment |
| `adjacent_to` | Subjects share a meaningful boundary or immediate vicinity |
| `connected_to` | A route, portal, corridor, service, or other link exists |
| `reachable_from` | Traversal is possible under stated conditions |
| `overlaps` | Places coexist in some spatial extent without simple containment |
| `hidden_within` | Containment exists but is concealed or unavailable to ordinary observation |
| `moves_through` | A mobile place or thing changes location relative to other places |
| `mirrors` | One place structurally or symbolically corresponds to another |
| `replaces` | One place occupies the role or extent of another across time or state |

Canonical text MUST describe the actual topology through typed spatial
relationships. A consumer MAY project those relationships as a map, building
view, route, or another topology-appropriate interaction, but that projection
is not a canonical universe image artifact.

## Universal relationship families

Relationships are canonical world facts, not captions invented by a consumer.
Every major entity MUST participate in at least one meaningful relationship.

### Spatial

- located in;
- contains;
- connects to;
- borders;
- originates from; and
- travels through.

### Social and political

- member of;
- leads;
- serves;
- governs;
- represents;
- allied with;
- opposes;
- protects; and
- exploits.

### Material and functional

- owns;
- uses;
- created;
- requires;
- produces;
- consumes;
- made from;
- powers; and
- damages.

### Taxonomic

- instance of;
- variant of;
- descended from; and
- related to.

### Causal and historical

- caused;
- participated in;
- changed by;
- preceded;
- resulted in;
- prevents; and
- depends on.

### Symbolic

- represents;
- identified by;
- sacred to;
- forbidden by; and
- commemorates.

Future schemas MAY define a closed relationship vocabulary with exact inverse,
cardinality, and temporal rules. V0 ratifies the families and ownership
boundary, not their serialization.

## Identity markers, flags, and symbols

A literal flag is not universal. An **identity marker** is.

An identity marker is a perceivable device through which an actor, collective,
place, thing, system, or idea is recognized. Valid forms include:

- flag or banner;
- sigil, crest, or seal;
- logo;
- glyph or rune;
- totem;
- tattoo;
- uniform marking or vehicle livery;
- color pairing or repeated pattern;
- material or architectural motif;
- gesture;
- written script; and
- sound or musical motif.

Every major collective MUST have at least one recognizable identity marker.
The selected form MUST follow the collective's culture, technology, materials,
institutions, and public behavior. A generator MUST NOT create a flag merely
because flags are common in another universe.

Every major place MUST have at least one place marker, such as a landmark,
skyline, material palette, environmental phenomenon, signage system, or
architectural silhouette.

An identity marker remains attached visual identity when it only identifies a
subject. It MUST also become a canonical `thing` when it has independent
history, ownership, power, physical custody, or conflict.

The baseline marker contract is a text record for one recognizable mark, its
materials, culturally correct applied use, meaning, limits, and historical
origin when the world assigns one. A marker that is not independently
significant enough to be an entity MAY appear only as a secondary diegetic
detail in its owning entity's continuous concept scene. It receives no
standalone symbol image. Construction sheets, variant atlases, comparison
boards, and brand kits are not canonical universe assets.

## Culture is composition

`culture` is not a V0 entity class. It is an explanatory composition across:

```text
collective
+ inhabited places
+ held or contested ideas
+ practiced systems
+ made and used things
+ remembered events
+ identity markers
+ relationships with others
```

This composition may produce clothing, architecture, food, tools, rituals,
ornament, language, authority, family structure, and attitudes toward
resources, death, outsiders, magic, technology, or history. The facts remain
owned by their canonical entities and relationships rather than being copied
into one undifferentiated culture record.

## Narrative roles

Entity class states what a subject is. Narrative role states how it functions
for one story, viewpoint, relationship, or explanation. Roles are contextual
and MUST NOT be treated as permanent identity.

Initial actor roles include:

- viewpoint;
- protagonist;
- opponent;
- ally;
- guide;
- gatekeeper;
- witness;
- victim;
- beneficiary;
- catalyst; and
- custodian.

Initial place roles include:

- home;
- destination;
- seat of power;
- frontier;
- sanctuary;
- prison;
- passage;
- threshold;
- contested territory;
- ruin; and
- forbidden zone.

Initial thing roles include:

- tool;
- resource;
- weapon;
- transport;
- key;
- evidence;
- relic;
- burden;
- status marker; and
- symbol.

Initial event roles include:

- origin;
- rupture;
- escalation;
- revelation;
- transformation;
- collapse; and
- aftermath.

The same place MAY be home to one actor and occupied territory to another. The
role therefore belongs to the applicable perspective or relationship, not to
the place in isolation.

## Entity concept asset purposes

An entity concept image is required because it gives one canonical entity a
recognizable visual identity, not because a media format is attractive or
common in a reference franchise. It MUST NOT be asked to prove exact counts,
topology, chronology, causality, system logic, or relationship structure; those
obligations belong to text and structured records.

| Purpose | Audience question |
| --- | --- |
| `orient` | Where is it, and how can subjects be reached? |
| `identify` | How do I recognize it? |
| `differentiate` | How is it unlike related subjects? |
| `manifest` | What observable form makes it physically legible? |
| `connect` | What does it affect, use, oppose, or depend on? |
| `historicize` | Why is it like this now? |
| `humanize` | How is it experienced in ordinary life? |
| `immerse` | What does it feel like to encounter or inhabit? |
| `invite` | What question should make the audience continue? |

Every required concept image MUST declare one primary purpose, exactly one
primary canonical entity, and the small set of world facts it can honestly make
visible. It MUST set `explanatory_visual` to false and `standalone_symbol` to
false. Context MAY establish scale, use, or habitation, but it MUST NOT turn the
image into a diagram, map, timeline, graph, atlas, sheet, kit, blueprint,
infographic, montage, labeled panel, or rationale board. A beautiful image that
answers no contracted question is promotional art, not required universe
coverage.

## Standard concept mode by entity class

Every canonical entity receives one coherent concept image. The primary class
selects the default mode; facets add context without adding panels or views.

| Subject | Baseline concept mode | Text-owned explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actor | Environmental identity portrait or one in-world action | Relationships, obligations, history, capabilities, and change |
| Collective | One representative public or working manifestation | Membership, authority, internal structure, politics, and rivals |
| Place | One establishing or inhabited environment | Topology, routes, containment, scale, and history |
| Thing | One hero or in-use study | Exact construction, variants, provenance, ownership, and mechanics |
| Kind | One representative specimen in context | Taxonomy, lifecycle, variants, anatomy, and behavior |
| System | One visible instance of the system in practice | Inputs, outputs, rules, exceptions, dependencies, and consequences |
| Event | One witnessed moment | Sequence, causes, participants, consequences, and disputed accounts |
| Idea | One practiced or contested manifestation | Meaning, competing interpretations, enforcement, and history |

The image MUST remain exactly one continuous scene, one panel, and one primary
entity. It MUST contain no typography, labels, arrows, legends, UI,
explanatory panels, turnarounds, variant grids, exact-count burden, standalone
symbol, or embedded rationale.

## Character world profile and pose derivation

Universe actors do not require gameplay statistics by default. A major actor
SHOULD instead provide world-facing attributes such as:

- origin and home;
- collective and cultural affiliation;
- social or institutional role;
- status and resources;
- capabilities and limitations;
- beliefs;
- goals and obligations;
- important relationships;
- historical involvement;
- signature thing;
- visual codes; and
- present tension or contradiction.

Pose, held object, environment, and action MUST be derived from those facts.
They MUST NOT be selected as disconnected visual decoration. The intended
derivation is:

```text
actor role
+ current intention
+ social status
+ relationship to place
+ relationship to thing or system
→ contextual actor artwork
```

No turnaround may be generated as a canonical artifact or visual production
control. Character continuity instructions MUST remain text-only production
records outside the canonical package.

## Canonical package and production-control records

Audience-facing universe assets and internal generation controls are distinct
contracts.

Canonical universe image assets are entity concept images only. Facts,
relationships, chronology, systems, viewpoints, conflicts, unresolved
questions, marker specifications, and ratification rationale are canonical
text or structured data. Maps, diagrams, graphs, timelines, blueprints,
atlases, dossiers, sheets, kits, and montages are consumer-owned views, not
baseline universe artifacts.

Production-control records keep generation coherent. They MUST be text or
structured data only, MUST live outside the canonical package, and MAY
describe:

- world visual grammar;
- relative scale constraints;
- regional palette and material language;
- architecture grammar;
- costume grammar;
- marker and heraldry rules;
- technology or magic design rules; and
- actor-to-environment compatibility constraints.

Visual production-control artifacts are forbidden: no turnaround, scale chart,
style sheet, brand board, compatibility board, rationale atlas, or other
rendered control may enter either the production-control record set or the
canonical package. Review proxies are the sole visual review instruments; they
MUST remain outside the canonical package and MUST NOT be treated as production
controls or universe assets.

## Engagement projections

Engagement projections compose canonical entities, relationships, text, and
concept images without becoming ontology classes or canonical media. Initial
projection families include:

- atlas or spatial explorer;
- field guide;
- actor, collective, or artifact dossier;
- timeline explorer;
- blueprint or building explorer;
- artifact archive;
- bestiary;
- illustrated encyclopedia;
- comic or short visual story;
- guided tour;
- investigation board;
- actor journey; and
- culture, era, or faction comparison.

A map and a comic are therefore not peer ontology categories. Both are
consumer-owned presentations that MAY be rendered later from the canonical
package; neither is a baseline universe artifact.

Every rendered engagement projection MUST live in a separate consumer-owned
output root. A consumer MAY reference canonical text and entity concept images,
but it MUST NOT copy, promote, or bind its rendered maps, diagrams, timelines,
graphs, atlases, dossiers, blueprints, comics, or other views back into the
canonical package.

## V1 generic consumer baseline

Because universe outputs have irregular classes, cardinality, topology, and
media, the minimum V1 consumer is a generic **graph explorer plus gallery**.
It is a package reader, not a second universe generator.

The graph explorer MUST:

- read canonical entities and structured relationship data rather than
  execution nodes or a pre-rendered graph artifact;
- support cyclic semantic relationships;
- filter by core class, declared narrower kind, and relationship family;
- expose the selected subject's facts, lineage, neighbors, and bound assets;
  and
- treat layout coordinates and clustering as client-owned presentation, not
  canonical world facts.

The gallery MUST:

- index every entity concept asset record without assuming a fixed asset census;
- filter by concept purpose, subject, core class, narrower kind, and media
  kind;
- cross-link selections back to their canonical subjects and relationships;
- expose metadata and a safe open or download path when it cannot present a
  media kind inline; and
- preserve review and publication state rather than treating file presence as
  acceptance.

An illustrated-map route was explored as a specialized map spike and has since
been removed from the viewer. It demonstrated a possible image-space orientation
projection, but its manifest did not carry the universe subject, relationship,
fact, review, and publication bindings required of a conforming consumer
projection. A future map consumer MAY bind to the canonical package; a map
manifest is not the root universe contract and MUST NOT be widened into one.
Atlas, timeline, blueprint, dossier, investigation, and other refined
experiences MAY later consume the same canonical package from their separate
consumer-owned output roots.

## V0 ratification rules

Before generation, a future universe ratifier MUST establish all of the
following:

1. At least one audience viewpoint exists.
2. At least one place exists.
3. Every major entity has meaningful relationships.
4. Every major actor is connected to a place and to at least one collective,
   thing, system, event, or idea.
5. Every entity has exactly one concept-image brief and an authoritative text
   record.
6. Every major collective has a culturally appropriate identity marker and an
   applied manifestation.
7. Every major system has a visible consequence for another entity.
8. Every major event changes the state or interpretation of another entity.
9. No empty franchise-shaped category is required.
10. No public asset is required solely because a reference universe had one.
11. Every required concept image states the audience question it answers and
    the limited facts it may visibly express.
12. Exact counts, topology, chronology, causality, systems, and relationships
    remain authoritative text even when a concept image evokes them.
13. Every accepted world claim records its source or generated-extension
    lineage.
14. The result satisfies the expansion direction without presenting that
    direction as a world fact.
15. Source conflicts and deliberate reinterpretations remain visible for
    review.
16. The semantic relationship data passes ontology, relationship, identity, and
    coverage admission before paid visual fan-out begins.
17. Every concept contract enforces one primary entity, one continuous scene,
    one panel, `explanatory_visual = false`, `standalone_symbol = false`, and
    every forbidden-form flag.
18. The physical package inventory contains exactly the enumerated entity image
    references and no other visual file; the current `the_weight_of_air`
    projection requires exactly 28 PNG references.
19. Every other package artifact is text or structured data, including the
    relational graph, facts, chronology, systems, viewpoints, conflicts,
    unresolved questions, markers, and review rationale.
20. Source posters, visual review proxies, and text-only production controls
    remain outside the canonical package.

Ratification MUST reject or return for revision:

- orphan entities;
- duplicate identities or unresolved aliases;
- contradictory relationships;
- systems without consequences;
- places without inhabitants, activity, or an explicit reason for emptiness;
- actors whose appearance has no world-derived cause;
- identity markers with no cultural or institutional basis;
- things disconnected from economy, occupation, history, system, or plot;
- concept art that communicates mood but no contracted world fact;
- a concept with more than one primary entity, scene, or panel;
- a standalone marker or symbol image;
- any explanatory visual, diagram, map, timeline, graph, atlas, sheet, kit,
  blueprint, infographic, or montage in the canonical package; and
- any unenumerated raster, vector, PDF, or video artifact in the physical
  package inventory.

Ratification is semantic admission, not provider retry. A failed world model
must be revised or regenerated as authored meaning before paid visual fan-out.

## Reference-category mapping

The familiar science-fiction databank categories demonstrate how one genre
projection maps into V0 without becoming the universal core:

| Databank category | V0 mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Characters | `actor` |
| Creatures | Named creature: `actor`; creature type: `kind` |
| Droids | `actor`, `thing`, or `kind` according to agency and scope |
| Locations | `place` |
| Organizations | `collective` |
| Species | `kind` |
| Vehicles | `thing`, optionally with a `place` facet |
| Weapons and technology | `thing` and/or `system` |
| More | `event`, `idea`, `system`, or a composed engagement projection |

This mapping allows a science-fiction profile to standardize `planet`,
`droid`, `vehicle`, or `weapon` later without requiring empty equivalents in a
building, historical, or magical universe.

## Genre-profile widening

V0 is the required semantic substrate. A future genre profile MAY widen it
with standard subject classes, subtypes, relationships, fields, entity-concept
specializations, consumer-owned projection modules, and coverage rules when the
genre makes those additions consistently useful.

A valid extension MUST declare:

1. the genre or higher-level universe family it serves;
2. the new vocabulary it introduces;
3. the V0 class or facet each addition refines;
4. whether each addition is required, conditionally required, or optional;
5. the relationships and explanatory questions it enables;
6. the entity-concept modes or consumer-owned projections it specializes; and
7. why an open authored kind is insufficient.

For example, a future science-fiction profile could promote `planet` to a
standard place subtype with orbit, environment, settlement, political, and
travel obligations. It could standardize the class even when one particular
universe leaves some instances unused. That decision belongs to the genre
profile, not to V0.

Genre profiles MUST NOT redefine the meaning of an existing V0 class, make
their vocabulary mandatory outside their declared scope, or push genre
semantics into Grida FX or FX Games' generic components. They MUST NOT add
canonical non-entity visuals or relax the closed physical package boundary;
rendered genre views remain in separate consumer-owned output roots.

## Versioning and next authority

This document is the V0 semantic authority. The next contract work SHOULD test
it against the agreed reference set: region-led fantasy, ecology-led science
fiction, city-led science fiction, building-led mystery, galaxy-scale
databanks, and archaeology-led fantasy.

That comparison should determine:

- which entity-concept modes are universal requirements;
- which are conditionally specialized by entity or relationship;
- which belong to genre profiles;
- which engagement projections deserve first-party support; and
- where V0 is too agnostic to produce a useful authored discipline.

Only after those decisions are ratified should the exact serialized schema,
staged node topology, persisted manifest shape, implementation, and specialized
consumer contracts be proposed. The conceptual source roles, target output
roles, and generic V1 graph-and-gallery baseline above are already part of this
V0 authority.
