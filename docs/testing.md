# Testing stage-gen

All routine verification is credential-free. Provider-backed tests carry the
`live` marker and are never selected by the locked offline gate.

## Focused matrix

| Surface | Command |
|---|---|
| Reusable components/providers | `uv run pytest tests/unit/components -q` |
| Verified single-axis image repeats | `uv run pytest tests/unit/components/image_repeat -q` |
| Deterministic media | `uv run pytest tests/unit/media -q` |
| Workflows | `uv run pytest tests/unit/workflows -q` |
| Game-owned graphs | `uv run pytest tests/unit/games -q` |
| CLI boundary | `uv run pytest tests/integration -q` |
| Wheel-packaged resources | `uv run pytest tests/contract/test_packaged_resources.py -q` |
| Import architecture | `uv run pytest tests/contract/test_import_boundaries.py -q` |
| Godot owners | `uv run --group games python godot/tools/check.py` |
| Scenario compiler/runtime/embedding | `uv run --group games python godot/tools/check.py --owner scenario_runtime` |
| Formatting and lint | `uv run ruff format --check . && uv run ruff check .` |
| Strict typing | `uv run mypy --strict src tests scripts` |

The Godot coordinator accounts for all maintained packages, games and templates.
Its native-game adapter uses authored temporary fixtures, including Ember Hollow
fixtures from `godot/games/ember_hollow/tools/make_fixture_run.py`. A fresh clone has
no `out/` media. Naming a real run with `--run` adds assertions pinned to that run;
prepared-media and rendered suites have explicit scopes and prerequisites. An
offline state check does not prove a picture or listening quality. See [Godot host](../godot/games/ember_hollow/docs/runtime.md) and
[decision 0068](decisions/0068-the-suite-reads-a-world-the-repository-can-write.md).

The product gate is `uv run python scripts/check.py`. It needs no Bun or Godot.
Use the owning optional scope or `--scope all` for the complete repository gate,
after `uv sync --all-groups --frozen`. See [VERIFICATION.md](../VERIFICATION.md).
The retained game tests require the optional `games` workspace group; use it when
selecting old test directories directly.

The pre-push hook checks each pushed commit in a temporary worktree, preserving the
working checkout. It installs all groups, then runs the format and lint checks, the web tests
and the contract tests, after building FX's engine for the pinned FX commit (needs cargo).

## Live provider tests

Live tests are opt-in and must use only documented allowlisted names from
`.env.example`. Never print values or run them as part of CI/offline checks.
Safe collection skips every live test and exits successfully:

```sh
STAGE_GEN_RUN_LIVE=0 uv run pytest -m live -q
```

An intentional provider run requires the explicit test gate:

```sh
STAGE_GEN_RUN_LIVE=1 uv run pytest -m live --basetemp out/live-smoke -q
```

A live test must preserve sanitized request/response facts, exact model and
endpoint identity, attempt count, validation, and artifact provenance. Visual
output accepted as evidence still requires semantic review by a non-producer;
audio quality review is separate from deterministic media validation. The live
gate requires explicit task intent; setting the flag does not broaden the
authorized scope.

## Optional web adapter

The web workspace uses Bun for Next.js tooling. It consumes published contracts
and starts nothing:

```sh
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun test
bun run --cwd viewer build
```

Web tests cover run-tag and artifact-path confinement, prepared-manifest
parsing, the run-view document and its camera math, vertical geometry, one-way
collision, ladder endpoint and state behavior, camera deadzones, combat,
progression, and bot navigation. A build must not require provider credentials
or execute a live generation request.

## Documentation and publication policy

For documentation or publication-policy changes, run these Python utilities. The
docs scope runs `check_docs.py`, the product gate runs `test_media_rights.py`, and
`test_docs_check.py` imports a game package, so it runs in the games scope
(`uv run --group games python scripts/check.py --scope games`):

```sh
uv run python scripts/check_docs.py
uv run --group games pytest tests/unit/test_media_rights.py tests/contract/test_docs_check.py -q
```

Two of the checker's rules bind prose to the tree. A backticked source path
must exist. And every specification under `docs/spec/` opens with a
`> **Checked by:** ...` line naming the test modules that read it, or `none.`
when nothing does; a named test must exist and must itself name the spec, so a
document cannot claim a checker it never had, and `none.` is an honest fact a
reader can act on rather than a pointer that rotted.

## System tools and packaged resources

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be on `PATH` for audio inspection (probing, level and
duration measurement). Component tests inject process runners where possible, but a
real music pipeline should fail clearly when those tools are unavailable.

The core wheel includes immutable layout templates under `stage_gen.resources`.
Game-only music and its provenance belong to the optional game tooling distribution. The contract test builds a
wheel in isolation, inspects its entries, extracts it away from the checkout,
and resolves every required resource through the installed helper API. Do not
restore checkout-relative resource lookup or symlink fixtures into a build.
