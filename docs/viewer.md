# The viewer

The viewer is the local web client for gnode runs: `gnode view` starts it. It lists every run
under the folders you give it, grouped by the workflow that made it, draws each run's execution
graph and artifacts, and shows each workflow's offline plan and the commands that run it. It is
read-only: it does not start runs, receives no provider credentials, and implements no gameplay.
Playable projects and their asset wiring belong to their Godot owners. The [site](site.md) is a
separate surface: it documents workflows and shows their examples, and it never reads run folders.

## Start it

```sh
uv run python scripts/view.py out/runs
uv run python scripts/view.py out/runs path/to/more-runs --port 3100 --no-open
```

`gnode view [runs]... [--port 3000] [--no-open]` shows the runs under each folder you name, or
the project's runs folder (`out/runs` here) when you name none. gnode keeps the run views and
ships no dashboard of its own; the one it starts is this viewer, which Stage Gen installs as a
gnode plugin of its own ([`stage_gen/viewer.py`](../src/stage_gen/viewer.py)). The
viewer is the Next app in [`web/viewer`](../web/viewer), so it needs a source checkout and Bun:
the plugin finds the checkout by walking up from the installed package, then from the working
directory, to the `pyproject.toml` named `stage-gen` that has `web/viewer` beside it. From an
installed wheel, or without Bun on `PATH`, `gnode view` exits 2 and points here. Install the web
workspace once with `cd web && bun install --frozen-lockfile`.

Before the server starts:

- gnode starts a thread that writes each workflow run's view into the view cache every three
  seconds when the run has changed (below).
- the plugin exports the catalog into `~/.cache/stage-gen/catalog/catalog.json` (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME`
  replaces `~/.cache` when it is an absolute path). The viewer groups runs by it and draws plans
  from it; it never plans anything itself.
- the plugin sets `STAGE_GEN_RUN_ROOTS` (the absolute run folders, joined by the platform's path
  separator), `STAGE_GEN_CATALOG`, `STAGE_GEN_VIEW_CACHE` (`~/.cache/gnode/views`) and
  `STAGE_GEN_REPO_ROOT` for the server. Provider keys are removed from the server's environment.

It then runs `bun run --cwd web/viewer dev --port PORT --hostname 127.0.0.1`, opens the browser
once the port answers unless `--no-open` is given. The server leads its own process group; when
`gnode view` ends, by Ctrl-C, SIGTERM, a hangup or the server exiting, it stops that whole group,
so nothing it started outlives it. The server listens on the loopback interface only.

Run without `gnode view` (`cd web/viewer && bun run dev`), the viewer reads `out/` of its
checkout and has neither a catalog nor a view cache: runs are listed ungrouped and only views a
run carries itself are drawn.

## Runs and their views

A run is a folder that holds `execution-plan.json`, `execution-view.json`, `manifest.json`,
`bundle.json` or `case.json`; or `plan.json` beside `events.jsonl` (a gnode workflow run). Runs are found up to
four folders below each root. A run's own folders are not searched again, hidden folders and
`node_modules` are skipped, symlinked folders are not followed out of the root, and the example
store at the top of a root (`out/examples`) is not a run
([`lib/shell/runs.ts`](../web/viewer/lib/shell/runs.ts)). gnode finds the workflow runs whose
views it keeps by the same rules ([`stage_gen/runview/refresh.py`](../src/stage_gen/runview/refresh.py)).

The view a run page draws is the run's own `execution-view.json`, or the one kept in the view
cache, whichever is newer. Kept views are written only under
`~/.cache/gnode/views/<first 16 hex digits of sha256(real path)>/execution-view.json`; neither the
viewer nor gnode writes into a run folder. gnode writes a workflow run's view when its
`plan.json` or `events.jsonl` is newer than its cached one, projected from those two files, with
each step's view context and, when its workflow has a view of its own, the whole run's. A game's
assets build with gnode, so its run is a workflow run like any other. Any other run is drawn from
the view it carries itself, or its row says none was exported.

The viewer reads any `*-execution-view-v1` envelope at `schema_version = 3`, and gnode's own
`gnode-run-view-v1`, which a workflow run's view carries. Header fields a producer
adds beside the envelope (`pipeline_id`, `title`, a graph document's `recipe` literal, a game's
ids, a view's `graph_kind`) are kept as the run's subject. Pipeline identities and node
type IDs need no registration. A user-authored pipeline uses the same graph, state, timing, cache,
artifact and provenance surfaces as an installed workflow, and node types without joined display
metadata use the generic node view. A document at another version is refused with a re-derive
message rather than migrated.

## Pages

- `/` lists every run under every root. Each installed workflow leads with its title and promise
  from the catalog and a link to its page; its runs follow, newest first, each with its state,
  node counts and when it last changed. Runs no workflow claims follow under "Game runs" (a graph
  document literal no workflow owns, or a consumer document) and "Other runs". Which workflow a
  run belongs to is read from the catalog's declared identities: an SDK run's pipeline id, a
  graph document's literal and graph kinds, a workflow run's graph kind.
- `/workflows/<id>` shows a workflow's promise and summary, its commands with a copy button, the
  graph it plans offline from its committed sample inputs (drawn as on a run page, with every node
  pending; each lane is a step), its steps, and its runs.
- `/runs/<root>/<tag>` is one run. `<root>` is a root's folder name and a short digest of its real
  path; `<tag>` is the run's root-relative path with `/` written as `~`. A run whose workflow has a
  view of its own (universe's gallery) is shown in that view, with the graph one link away
  (`?view=graph`); any other run with a view fills the window with its graph and node inspector; a
  run with neither says how to get a view. `/runs/<root>/<tag>/artifacts`
  lists the declared outputs.

While a run on a page is live (its trace was written in the last fifteen minutes and it has not
finished), the page refreshes itself every two seconds; the graph keeps its camera and selection.

## Artifact previews

The application selects renderers for image, audio, video, text, and data artifacts. A display
hint the renderer has no view for falls back to an ordinary artifact link. GNode carries renderer
hints as JSON; it does not own a sprite or parallax contract.

The historical `motion` field still describes a uniform strip of 1 through 16 frames. Its
application-owned parser preserves that bound; a different atlas layout needs its own preview
kind. The existing motion player provides frame stepping and sample playback.

Unknown preview kinds retain the ordinary artifact fallback. Model files such as GLB retain their
media type and can be opened or downloaded; there is no dedicated spatial renderer yet.
[`artifact-preview.ts`](../web/ui/contracts/artifact-preview.ts) owns these adapters. Adding a
renderer is an application change, independent of adding a workflow.

## Step views

A run of a gnode workflow can keep its steps' own views. A view is an HTML template and a
read-only context ([`view-context.ts`](../web/ui/contracts/view-context.ts)); a node type declares
its default view, and a step's `view: true` (a generic image, JSON or video view when its type has none)
or `view: <file>` marks it as worth looking at. When such a step finishes, the run keeps the
template under `views/<digest>.html` and every file the view shows under `views/files/`, so a
copied run folder still shows its views. `gnode view` writes each context next to the run's
view, in `view-contexts.json`: the step's inputs, outputs, facts and title, with each file's
run-local path and a small JSON file's value inline.

The node inspector shows a step's view first, in a frame
([`ViewFrame.tsx`](../web/viewer/app/runs/[root]/[tag]/ViewFrame.tsx)) sandboxed to scripts
only, so it runs in an opaque origin. The frame asks for its context when it is ready; the viewer
answers with each file given its asset URL. A view only draws: it can open nothing in the viewer,
reach no file it was not given, and load only from the origins the run's `gnode.yaml` lists in
`view_origins`. Looping parallax's compose step ships one that scrolls the composed layers, and
movie-sprite's finish step one that plays the loop's preview beside its contact sheet and checks.

## Serving and boundaries

`/api/assets/<root>/<tag>/<path>` serves files under one run folder of one configured root. It
validates the root key, each tag segment and the portable artifact path, checks filesystem
confinement, and refuses symlink escapes. It serves known passive image, audio, video, model,
text, and JSON media types, with an opaque fallback and `nosniff`. It serves HTML only for a
run's kept view templates (`views/<digest>.html`), always under a content security policy that
sandboxes it to scripts in an opaque origin and limits what it may load; it serves no other HTML,
and no SVG media type.

Nothing under [`lib/shell`](../web/viewer/lib/shell) starts a subprocess, and a docs check fails if
anything there imports one. Generation, retry, cache admission, artifact publication and deriving a
run view belong to gnode and the Python application; the viewer only reads what it is given. The web
workspace imports no game engine. The viewer reads the run-view, catalog and example wire formats
through the shared parsers in [`web/ui/contracts`](../web/ui/contracts), whose hand-authored
fixtures a Python contract test also validates.

## Presentation

The shell uses Tailwind CSS v4. [`app/globals.css`](../web/viewer/app/globals.css) declares design
tokens and the transparent-image checkerboard; [`app/ui.ts`](../web/viewer/app/ui.ts) holds shared
utility class strings.

## Verification

Credential-free gates for this boundary are:

```sh
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun test
bun run --cwd viewer build
cd ..
uv run pytest -q tests/unit/test_run_views.py tests/unit/test_viewer.py
```

Tests cover multi-root discovery, the derived-view cache and its fallback, grouping by workflow,
generic view parsing, confined paths, bounded previews, node and graph inspection, the workflow
page, the specialized output views, and the launcher's environment and refusals. A browser check
can prove that supplied layers load and respond to preview controls. It does not establish
generated-media quality or prove that a game is playable.
