# Decisions

One record per ruling. Each file is `NNNN-<slug>.md` and carries exactly five sections —
**Fact** (what was true, cited), **Challenge** (the reading someone would reach for first,
argued honestly), **Ruling** (what was decided and where the boundary is), **Evidence** (what
was measured, and what it cost), and **Falsifier** (the observation that would overturn it).

These were seeded from `TODO.md`, which had become a decision log wearing a todo list: 1391
lines, more than half of them inside completed items. A completed item that recorded no
decision was dropped rather than promoted, and a ruling recorded inside an item still open for
execution was promoted anyway, because the ruling is settled even when the work is not.

A record is history. It is not held to the current contract version — the identity contract
test exempts this directory for that reason — and it is not amended when the tree moves past
it. A ruling that is overturned gets a new record that says so.

Current supersession: [0070](0070-the-game-invokes-scenario.md) moves Scenario ownership
from Stage Gen to Godot and establishes game-owned invocation. It supersedes the
relevant provisions of 0001/0005 and limits universal readings of 0008/0014; 0009
and 0066 retain their evidence requirements. Historical records below remain unchanged.
[0071](0071-workflows-are-the-product-unit-and-the-web-splits-into-site-and-viewer.md)
supersedes [0069](0069-the-platformer-is-retired-and-web-is-only-the-viewer.md) only on the
viewer being launched by the CLI, multi-root and workflow-aware.
[0072](0072-gnode-is-one-engine-behind-text-contracts.md) removes the storefront workflow
that 0071 listed and replaces the execution substrates 0071 left in place.
[0073](0073-concept-studio-is-a-skill-not-an-application.md) overturns 0072's M8f: Concept
Studio is no longer an application but a skill users install.
[0074](0074-stage-gen-runs-on-grida-fx.md) moves the engine out of this repository: Stage Gen
runs on Grida FX, gnode is deleted, and 0072's R9, R9b and `gnode-*` documents are superseded.
[0075](0075-runs-are-seen-in-fx.md) retires the viewer 0071 split out: runs are seen in FX's
viewer.

| [0065](0065-the-runner-is-retired-from-the-browser.md) | The runner is retired from the browser | 14,133 lines go on a state proof of six hundred exact frames; the picture was one measurement short and the record says so |
| [0066](0066-a-state-proof-is-not-a-picture-proof.md) | A state proof is not a picture proof | Everything 0065's proof could not see shipped broken, so a genre is not ported until its picture is measured and the gate is shown to fail |

| [0068](0068-the-suite-reads-a-world-the-repository-can-write.md) | The suite reads a world the repository can write | A gate that needs a run nobody can regenerate is a gate that decays; the suite writes its own fixture |
| [0069](0069-the-platformer-is-retired-and-web-is-only-the-viewer.md) | The platformer is retired, and the web is only the viewer | The last 67,356 lines go; the picture gate 0066 asked for was rejected as a harness, and playing it found seventeen defects no hash could see |
| [0070](0070-the-game-invokes-scenario.md) | The game invokes Scenario | One Godot-owned sequence executor, data-only content and versioned game capabilities; supported v2 inputs remain |
| [0071](0071-workflows-are-the-product-unit-and-the-web-splits-into-site-and-viewer.md) | Workflows are the product unit, and the web splits into a site and a viewer | One folder per deliverable describes itself; the site is built from the catalog and pinned examples, the viewer is the CLI's local client |
| [0072](0072-gnode-is-one-engine-behind-text-contracts.md) | gnode is one engine behind text contracts | Four substrates become one runner; workflows become YAML over standard node types, bodies one callback, runs one event log, ported milestone by milestone with honest re-keys |
| [0073](0073-concept-studio-is-a-skill-not-an-application.md) | Concept Studio is a skill, not an application | The `stage-gen-concept` distribution goes; concept work is an installable skill that stands alone in any folder and draws through Grida FX |
| [0074](0074-stage-gen-runs-on-grida-fx.md) | Stage Gen runs on Grida FX | gnode becomes a standalone product consumed as a submodule; no cache replay, stand-ins replace injected services, and the run view moves into Stage Gen |
| [0075](0075-runs-are-seen-in-fx.md) | Runs are seen in FX | Stage Gen's viewer goes; FX's viewer draws every run, and the run view stays only for the examples store |
