# Repository directory preview

This is the implemented ownership layout for the asset-pipeline product and its
consumers. It shows directories at the level where responsibility changes. It is
not a proposed universal taxonomy, and it does not imply that every capability
already has an end-to-end generation example.

`library/characters/` holds the committed, approved character-3d examples (Nami, Riko
and Helix), which the catalog builds from their tracked files. The game inputs belong
to their individual Godot games; each workflow's sample inputs belong to its folder.
Users supply external input, output and cache directories rather than registering
projects inside this checkout.

`concept-studio/` remains the existing concept-content workspace, with its ignored
drafts and curated media rights records. The concept work itself is the
`skills/game-concept-studio` skill, which stands alone in a user's own folder.

`skills/` holds skills users install, for example with `npx skills add`. Each one stands
alone: it names no path in this repository and no command of it. `.agents/skills/`
(`.claude/skills` links to it) holds the skills for working on this repository.

```

FX Games adds no graph engine: every workflow, game build and user project is an FX
workflow file or Python builder, planned and run by Grida FX. Routes, provider adapters,
retries and provider keys belong to FX; a project's `fx.yaml` picks its routes, and no
workflow takes ownership of credentials or provider selection.

The wheel contains `fx_games` and depends on `grida`, which `uv sync` installs from the
submodule. Optional demo packages have their own project metadata. The core source
distribution removes workspace-only metadata, so installing it does not require absent
demo directories.

└── voice_profile/                     # Reusable voice definitions
```

These names describe actual component families. A component need not be fully
agnostic about its medium: a sprite component can understand frames and foot
anchors, and a terrain component can understand occupancy. It must not infer a
complete game's combat, quests, camera controller or runtime state.

The structural ground algorithm was promoted out of the runner. Actor scale now
accepts an explicit pixels-per-unit contract, with old player/tile calibration in
the game-owned adapter. UI, effects, screens, music and voices were split from their
former game aggregates. Game readers still supply game-specific role sets,
event triggers and playback bindings to those independent capabilities.

The `.scenario` contract is owned by the Godot Scenario package, including its
independent authoring distribution. The game invokes its sequence through explicit
bindings; the asset product does not depend on that format. Sprite playback,
portrait animation and movie sprite assets retain their own bounded roles.

```

A workflow written as a workflow file has the shape `looping_parallax/`, `movie_sprite/`,
`portrait_motion/` and `universe/` show. The tree lists
only what differs. Sample inputs and their scripts live in a
workflow's `inputs/`. A future component example should likewise live beside that
component. Documentation links these owners instead of creating a second
implementation under a central examples framework.

The looping-parallax workflow accepts supplied layers. It produces repeating images,
canvas/offset/order/scroll metadata and a preview frame. It does **not** yet extract
hidden layers from one finished reference image. That operation can be added as a bounded
upstream generation stage with its own validation, while the repeat/composition/preview
stages remain reusable.

Portrait motion's steps and judges belong to its workflow; the prompts, validators, crop,
composition and reconstruction they compose remain in the component.

Examples are not committed. `scripts/examples.py promote` and `demo-games example export`
write frozen exports into the local, gitignored store `out/examples/<owner>/<id>/`, and each
owner's manifest pins them by digest.

## Documentation

`docs/` holds only what crosses workflows: [getting started](getting-started.md), the
[glossary](glossary.md), the [site](site.md) guide, provider notes
under `models/`, policy (storage, publication, IP), cross-cutting specifications under
`spec/`, and the history under `decisions/`, `plans/` and `research/`. A workflow's guide and
contract live in its own `page.mdx` and `contract.md`; a game's documents live under its
folder. How to write, plan and run a workflow is the
[FX guide](https://github.com/gridaco/fx/blob/main/docs/guide/README.md), with its example
projects, in gridaco/fx.

```

Each of the four run-consuming games has `project.godot`, its own `main.tscn` and a
separately packaged Python builder. Each is an FX project that builds from its own folder
with `pipeline/workflow.py` (`python -m grida.fx plan pipeline/workflow.py:build --arg
package=inputs` for Iron Petal Unit), expanded once for Bellweather above. The Grain also
keeps `pipeline/prepare.py`, which proves its case and publishes it over the runs of its
rooms and scene.
Afterlight and Command Link keep their working project organization and game-local
Labs; this is not a mandatory directory schema for a new game.

Inputs live with each game. Game inputs have no root `main.toml` selector and no
`library`, `legacy` or empty `demos` tier; `library/` holds only the approved
character-3d examples. Existing TOML member paths, identities and
cache semantics remain supported by the same consuming game. Gameplay parameters
may move into GDScript or resources later, independently for each game.

`_shared` is private implementation with actual multiple-game callers. Single-game
rules, rendering and builders stay with their game. Shared code imports no named
game. The collection CLI under `godot/tools/` can import all game preparation
packages; its `demo-games` commands support existing format inspection and fixture
maintenance. The optional `games` installation group keeps all of this outside the
public product's default environment and distributions.

The asset-consumer template copies a selected asset and its verified provenance;
its GDScript loads that local content. A game can extend preparation to create
resources, bind animations and wire scenes. Starting Godot reads prepared assets
and does not start a provider operation. Existing `out/` runs remain at their
current locations and are selected explicitly.

Maintained game format documents live under their game or `_shared/docs`.
The current [Scenario directory preview](../godot/packages/scenario_runtime/docs/layout.md)
expands authoring, execution and game binding ownership. Side-view map design
remains in `docs/spec/`; its former Scenario page points to the Godot owner. Historical decisions remain records of their original context. The
[Godot ownership record](plans/godot-consumer-layout.md) details the migration.

## Choosing the owner of a new change

| Change | Owner |
|---|---|
| Scheduling, graph state, the store, run records, prices, retries | Grida FX (`third_party/fx`, under its own rules) |
| A capability, route or provider request/response adaptation | Grida FX |
| A project's choice of routes | That project's `fx.yaml` |
| Reading FX runs for examples | `fx_games.runview` |
| Asset-specific processing and admission | Component |
| Several asset stages with a bounded output | Workflow |
| User-specific graph composition | The user's own FX workflow file or Python builder |
| Workflow asset parameters | The workflow's typed `inputs:`, given by an inputs file or flags |
| A specialized preview | A site player, a view in FX, or a bounded runtime package |
| VN-oriented narrative authoring and invocation | Godot Scenario package |
| Episode direction and installed game capabilities | Consuming game |
| Resource import and asset-to-scene binding | Consumer's preparation script |
| Combat, progression, quest state or scene control | Consumer's code |
| Existing game TOML or whole-game build maintenance | Named game preparation package; shared reader only where reused |

The gates follow these owners. The default gate verifies the product without
installing or invoking Godot and Bun. Optional scopes verify their consumers, and
`--scope all` exercises the entire repository. See [verification](../VERIFICATION.md)
and the [implementation ledger](plans/repository-reshape.md).
