# Authored character profiles

A character profile is reusable, human-authored identity: not generated output, a
provider cache, a workflow input, or a publication root. A profile is a **member
of the game package that binds it**, named by exact relative path and exact
bytes, the same way that package names every other authored member:

```text
godot/games/<game>/inputs/character.toml
```

A profile that no package names is a file nothing can resolve, and a package that
names one owns its rights statement alongside its own.

The shared cast under [`library/characters/`](../library/characters/README.md) is a
different thing: committed, reviewed artwork and 3D models for documentation and
demonstrations. Its `sd_3d.*` triplets are the approved character-3d examples Nami,
Riko and Helix, which the `character-3d` workflow pins by digest and the catalog builds
from those tracked files. A library character is not a profile that a game package
binds.

`profile_id` is a stable logical identity. Increment `revision` whenever any
semantic profile value, rights statement, or reference binding changes. The
shipped `edwin-price` profile is intentionally `unreviewed` and has no media
references. It demonstrates the contract without implying generated artwork,
redistribution permission, or publication approval.

## Format and canonical identity

TOML is the preferred human-authoring format because it supports comments and
readable tables. Strict JSON is an equal input encoding for tooling and
interchange. Both pass through the same `CharacterProfile` model and therefore
have one authority: the validated model, not two synchronized source files.

The programmatic API is:

```python
from demo_game_tools.kits.character_profile import (
    canonical_character_profile_json,
    character_profile_sha256,
    load_character_profile,
)

profile = load_character_profile("godot/games/the_grain/inputs/characters/edwin.toml")
artifact_bytes = canonical_character_profile_json(profile)
artifact_sha256 = character_profile_sha256(profile)
```

Canonical artifact bytes are compact, key-sorted, NFC-normalized UTF-8 JSON
without a trailing newline. Optional null values are omitted. The SHA-256 of
those exact bytes is the profile content identity used by profile-aware consumers.
Never persist TOML as a generated wire artifact or compute lineage from source
formatting, comments, or key order.

The loader rejects duplicate keys, unknown or camelCase fields, unsupported
versions/kinds, TOML native date/time values, and invalid rights states. All
reference paths are relative to the profile directory, normalized with forward
slashes, digest-bound, and existing regular files. Absolute paths, URLs/URIs,
`file:`, parent traversal, and backslashes fail closed. The public path loader
opens the profile once and rejects symlinks in every source, reference-root, and
reference-path ancestor or final component; the library resolver uses the same
descriptor-confined reader. Callers supplying a custom `reference_reader` own
that reader's filesystem policy. A reference has its own explicit rights
statement; profile rights never silently grant rights to external bytes.

Authored profiles are workspace content, not Python package data. The repository
sample remains available in a source checkout; the public Stage Gen distribution
does not bundle Godot game inputs. An installed CLI receives the package
directory explicitly with `--package-root PATH`. Profile-aware game graphs use the
exact shared binding below; the source digest binds authored bytes while the
shared resolver computes canonical profile identity only after loader
validation, resolving the ref inside that package root and following no symlink:

```toml
[character_profile]
schema_version = 1
kind = "character-profile-binding-v1"
ref = "character.toml"
source_sha256 = "<sha256-of-the-exact-character.toml-bytes>"
```

From the repository root, validate the contract and print the authored-source
digest required by that binding without calling a provider or writing output:

```sh
uv run --group games demo-games character-profile validate \
  --input godot/games/the_grain/inputs/characters/edwin.toml \
  --package-root godot/games/the_grain/inputs
uv run --group games demo-games character-profile digest \
  --input godot/games/the_grain/inputs/characters/edwin.toml \
  --package-root godot/games/the_grain/inputs
```

`validate` emits deterministic compact lower_snake_case JSON containing stable
identity, revision, rights status, source digest, and canonical digest. `digest`
prints only the lowercase authored-source SHA-256 used as `source_sha256`.

## Runnable game inputs

The game's scene build takes a package directory, and the package names its own members.
From `godot/games/the_grain`:

```sh
uv run python -m grida.fx plan pipeline/workflow.py:scene --arg package=inputs
```

The game owns this build. Planning is offline; run it with
`uv run python -m grida.fx run … --live --max-usd N` only for explicitly authorized provider
execution.

A prepared game binds its cast in `game.toml` rather than in a request document,
so Bellweather's build reads authored profiles through the package it is given. The
scene build publishes each canonical profile at `characters/<actor>.json` inside a
`dialogue-scene-bundle-v9` whose `recipe_version` is `dialogue-scene-v8`. These
artifacts carry identity and lineage; they do not authorize publication.

The scene document resolves only package-relative TOML members, rejects symlink
or digest tampering while planning, before provider work, and the bundle binds each
canonical profile by digest; the FX run records how each file was made.
This integration does not define pose, expression, shot, provider conditioning,
generated observation, runtime placement, or publication approval.

Per-shot direction, pose conditioning, generated observation, and cross-image
consistency remain explicitly proposed research in
[Dialogue character direction and observation](research/dialogue-character-direction.md);
the scene document neither accepts nor synthesizes them from a profile.
