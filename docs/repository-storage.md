# Repository storage policy

Generated run output belongs below the configured output directory and stays
gitignored: Grida FX writes this repository's runs to `out/runs` and its store
to `out/fx-cache`, and a project folder's own `.fx/` is ignored too. Commit
only small, deliberate fixtures needed to build, test, or explain a contract. A
canonical prepared game may also commit its explicitly digest-bound image
inputs within each `godot/games/<game>/inputs/` closure and its digest-bound
typefaces within that closure; those are authored package members, not
generated run output. Bellweather keeps complete closures under
`inputs/default/` and `inputs/waves/`; the other prepared games use `inputs/`.

README-only repository marketing assets live under `.github/assets/readme/`.
Use efficient WebP stills and optimized GIF animations for repository presentation.
Keep canonical game inputs, documentation evidence, and runtime assets in their
own locations. Lossless working files and raw captures remain ignored.

Documentation media lives under `docs/media/` for raster figures and captures
and `docs/diagrams/` for authored vector diagrams. Both hold work the repository
authors to explain a contract, so neither is a generated-media publication root
and neither uses `.meta.json` sidecars. Encode rasters as WebP, and bind a
figure to the build it was composited from in the prose that carries it.

## Git LFS decision

Git LFS is not enabled. A fresh OSS checkout should not depend on another
authenticated storage surface while the repository remains within its
enforced binary limits. Current sizes are deliberately not copied into this
document because they change whenever an approved fixture or publication is
replaced.

The repository gates enforce these binary-media limits:

- audio: 20 MiB per file;
- font: 2 MiB per file;
- image: 5 MiB per file;
- model: 10 MiB per file;
- video: 25 MiB per file; and
- all tracked/generated media combined: 125 MiB.

The aggregate ceiling accommodates the canonical 92-image style-dictionary preview
family under `concept-studio/style-dictionary/` and the canonical character library.
The increase from 100 to 125 MiB reserves space for Nami and Riko's two 3D SD models
and their rendered previews while preserving the existing canonical artwork. Models
count toward the same aggregate as every other media family. The style dictionary
uses full-resolution, deterministic lossy WebP encodes and remains subject to the
unchanged 5 MiB per-image limit. Lossless working files and provider-returned originals
remain ignored run output.

Git LFS remains disabled for this publication. The bounded preview family stays below the existing
50 MiB family-level reconsideration threshold, no individual preview approaches the large-source
threshold, and a public checkout therefore remains independent of an authenticated LFS service.

Run the canonical current-tree checks from the repository root:

```sh
uv run python scripts/check_docs.py
uv run pytest -q tests/contract/test_packaged_resources.py::test_repository_media_obeys_git_size_and_location_policy
uv run pytest -q tests/contract/test_character_library.py
```

The documentation checker validates every inventoried generated-media file,
and the focused contract test discovers tracked media and computes each current
file size and the aggregate. Neither gate relies on a documented size snapshot.

Reconsider LFS when either:

1. one intentionally tracked binary reaches 10 MiB; or
2. a frequently revised binary family is projected to contribute at least
   50 MiB of reachable history.

`.gitattributes` cannot select by file size. If a threshold is crossed, add
extension-wide root patterns only for the affected large-source family, such
as layered artwork, lossless audio, source animation, or video. Do not route
all PNG/GIF or a small compressed placeholder through LFS preemptively.

Before enabling LFS, verify remote upload/download access and quota for public
contributors. Migrate existing matching history deliberately; adding a pattern
does not move older blobs automatically.

## Canonical character models

The character library may retain one self-contained `sd_3d.glb` and one rendered
`sd_3d.webp` beside each character's authored images. A GLB must embed its geometry
buffers and textures; external files, data references and symlinked inputs are not
part of this representation. Other model formats and generated working files stay
outside the tracked library.

The adjacent `sd_3d.json` record binds the canonical source image, generation and
processing facts, and exact model and preview bytes. It records an artifact-specific
redistribution decision and an independent passing review whose report is also
bound by digest and byte count. The character's README links the representation
and explains its limits. The library contract verifies those bindings and embedded
GLB resources; runtime or provider success alone does not admit a representation.

This is a curated library representation, not a new generated-media inventory root.
The library owns its record and review; it does not use an unrelated image or
browser-capture publication subtype. Raw responses, rejected candidates, working
Blender files and execution logs remain ignored run output. Review the existing LFS
thresholds against the final model sizes and expected revision history before
landing larger binary families.

## Game media under `godot/games/`

Afterlight and Command Link keep their playable image, audio and video bytes out of Git
and describe them through tracked catalogs, manifests and digests. The present
arrangement, what a fresh clone can do, and the deferred discipline for adopting
media into Git are anchored in [`godot/games/README.md`](../godot/games/README.md).

## Hygiene

- Do not commit `.DS_Store` or editor metadata.
- Do not commit populated env files, run output, caches, or screenshots created
  solely by local verification.
- Keep README-only marketing images under `.github/assets/readme/`, use efficient
  WebP stills or optimized GIF animations, and limit them to repository presentation.
- Every committed binary needs a reason, provenance, and rights status.
- Prepared-package image inputs are allowed only beneath
  the owning game input closure's `references/` directory. Their owning TOML contracts must bind
  exact digests and inline rights basis, while `game.toml` binds the selected
  evidence and reviews. They do not use generated-output `.meta.json` sidecars.
- A prepared-package typeface is allowed only beneath
  the owning game input closure's `fonts/` directory, with the face's licence file committed beside
  it, and its owning TOML contract binds the exact digest and the licence the same
  way. A face is a third-party input with a rights basis, not provider output
  published as art: it carries no inventory entry and no `.meta.json` sidecar.
  See [decision 0063](decisions/0063-a-typeface-is-a-package-input.md).
- Generated media in declared publication roots must be enumerated in
  [`generated-media-inventory.json`](generated-media-inventory.json) and pass
  the [generated-media publication gate](generated-media-publication.md). The
  roots are provider output published as art; adding one is a deliberate
  decision, not the default for any directory that happens to hold images.
- Purging a rights-sensitive blob requires rewriting every reachable ref and
  coordinating the remote history update; deleting it only at HEAD is not
  sufficient.
