# Models

These records capture hosted-model and provider request surfaces. Individual
records distinguish measured evidence from documentation research and summarize
the route that consumes a model. Grida FX's route table and each project's
`fx.yaml` remain the runtime authority; re-check current metadata and live
behavior before widening a route.

## Model records

- [GPT Image 2.5](gpt-image-2.5.md) — the current Stage Gen image family:
  Sunburst routes at maximum quality through OpenAI Images, fal, or OpenRouter,
  the last without native alpha.
- [GPT Image 2](gpt-image-2.md) — legacy provider capabilities and measured
  native-alpha evidence retained as historical record.
- [Eleven Text to Sound v2](../spec/model-eleven-text-to-sound-v2.md) — measured
  sound-effect generation boundary.
- [Eleven v3](../spec/model-eleven-v3.md) — measured speech-generation boundary.
- [ElevenLabs v3 anime voices](elevenlabs-v3-anime-voices.md) — the voices a
  person has auditioned and accepted for anime-style game characters.

## Provider operations

- [Provider operations](providers.md) — keys, the routes each workflow and game
  picks and why, and what this repository measured about them; Grida FX owns the
  adapters, retries and billing.
- [GPT Image 2.5](gpt-image-2.5.md) — the current Sunburst route split and its provider
  contract.

## Capability surveys

- [3D AI capabilities](3d-capabilities.md) — generation, existing-mesh editing,
  texturing, parts, topology, rigging and motion across direct APIs, fal,
  app features and local research models; checked 2026-09-09, without inference.

Model records describe observed external capabilities. Each project's
`fx.yaml` and the route tables it reads remain authoritative for what Stage Gen
currently uses.
