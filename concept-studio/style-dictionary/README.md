# 2D game style dictionary

> **Status: canonical tracked prompt dictionary, reviewed gallery, and active research guide.**
>
> This master owns the reviewed 48-entry GPT Image 2 / Grok Image 2 prompt
> gallery, the broader illustration vocabulary, and the concept-to-asset

This is a reproducible prompt-and-generation dictionary grounded in exact visual
surfaces from commercially iconic games. Every gallery record sends the
byte-identical text prompt and registered requested aspect to
`openai/gpt-image-2` and `x-ai/grok-imagine-image-2.0`. The requested aspect is
preserved for generated outputs except the documented Banner Saga Grok fallback:
its exact prompt returned no image at `21:9`, then generated at `16:9`. Each
returned source output is reviewed against the same four visible style markers.
Game names and source links are research metadata; the exact provider text is
reproduced in full under each record and remains original and brand-neutral.

The gallery uses deterministic WebP preview paths rather than linking into ignored
`out/` work. [`manifest.json`](manifest.json) binds the exact prompt, provider,
model, source digest, preview digest, dimensions, and deterministic publication
transform for every slot. Evidence JSON copied beside this document records the
reviewed source profiles, failure classifications, and category verdicts. Raw
provider responses, superseded generations, and temporary comparisons remain
ignored working evidence.

## Purpose

This lab studies whether image models respond to illustration-style words in a
repeatable and useful way for 2D games. The target is controllable
micro-variance: terms such as `super-deformed`, `shonen manga`, `soft cel
shading`, or `screentone manga` should be more informative than a broad request
such as `Japanese style`.

Game use is wider than actor sprites. A useful style may need to carry across a
cutscene still, dialogue portrait, environment background, prop illustration,
card image, loading screen, UI icon, or effect sheet. Production role is kept
separate from visual style so a model cannot appear to understand a style merely
because it changed the crop or produced a familiar asset layout.

This document has five jobs:

1. inventory candidate words without claiming that they work;
2. derive neutral descriptors from commercially proven 2D-game anchors;
3. preserve the reviewed model-pair prompt dictionary and its exact verdicts;
4. define a concept-to-focused-asset experiment plus atomic follow-up tests; and
5. remain the single tracked guide to results that survive review and promotion.

The inventory is deliberately broad, but it is not a claim to enumerate every
illustration tradition or every community's preferred terminology. Terms should
be corrected as stronger sources or practitioners provide better language.

The global [game visual reference and vocabulary](../../docs/game-visual-reference.md)
owns the game-first seed catalog and shared keyword-admission rules. This lab
consumes selected records, adds stronger research, and owns model-specific test
evidence; it does not duplicate or silently mutate the global reference list.

## Repository boundary and lifecycle

This directory is tracked pre-production research under `concept-studio/`. It does not extend
`src/fx_games/components/`, define a recipe, or alter the implemented
[image style anchor](../../docs/image-style-anchor.md). The current runtime anchor has
three coarse modes. This lab may provide evidence for a future vocabulary
revision, but no result changes runtime behavior automatically.

The proposed working lifecycle is:

```text
concept-studio/style-dictionary/README.md
    canonical text taxonomy, reviewed prompt dictionary, protocol, and findings

concept-studio/style-dictionary/images/
    exact WebP previews consumed directly by this Markdown document

concept-studio/style-dictionary/manifest.json
    portable prompt, model, source, transform, and preview bindings

out/illustration-style-taxonomy/
    ignored raw candidates, superseded generations, and temporary comparisons
```

The 92 selected previews are the only generated images tracked by this dictionary.
Their exact final bytes are bound by the manifest, the shared
[independent visual review](images/style-dictionary.visual-review.md), and the
repository publication gate. A
style-recognition failure remains visible as a negative dictionary result; it does
not make the exact reviewed preview invalid evidence. This collection is not a
runtime fixture, a Concept Studio game gallery, or a standalone reusable asset pack.
New or replaced previews must update the manifest and review record and pass the
repository media gates before commit.

## Core rule: labels are candidates; observable facets are controls

A label can mix several things:

- a medium or production process;
- a line, shading, palette, or surface treatment;
- a character-design grammar;
- a publishing demographic or market lineage;
- a story genre or affect;
- a production role or layout; and
- a cultural or historical tradition.

Those are not interchangeable. For example:

- `moe` is primarily an affective and cultural label, not a precise rendering
  method;
- `shonen`, `shojo`, `seinen`, and `josei` begin as publishing demographics,
  even though visual dialects can correlate with them;
- `webtoon` is primarily a digital comics format;
- `chibi` or `super-deformed` primarily controls proportion and simplification;
  and
- `cutscene still` is an asset role, not a style.

The lab preserves recognized labels because a model may know them, but any
accepted control must be restated as visible traits. A useful style direction is
therefore faceted rather than a bag of fashionable words:

```text
visual lineage
+ character-design grammar
+ line language
+ shading model
+ palette/value model
+ surface treatment
+ era or production technique, when relevant
+ independently selected asset treatment
```

Pose, camera, crop, subject, costume, setting, and asset role stay outside that
style expression. Experiments freeze them where possible.

## Taxonomy axes

| Axis | What it describes | Example values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visual_lineage` | A recognized illustration, comic, print, or painting dialect | `gekiga`, `ukiyo_e`, `ligne_claire` |
| `character_design_grammar` | Proportion, facial construction, and silhouette abstraction | `super_deformed`, `adult_anime_proportions`, `angular_silhouette` |
| `line_language` | Contour weight, continuity, and mark character | `fine_tapered_line`, `bold_contour`, `broken_contour` |
| `shading_model` | How value describes form | `one_band_cel`, `soft_cel`, `continuous_tonal` |
| `color_language` | Palette size, saturation, value key, and color relationships | `limited_palette`, `high_key_pastel`, `jewel_toned` |
| `surface_language` | Visible substrate, print, pigment, or digital texture | `paper_grain`, `analog_cel_texture`, `multi_pass_print_misregistration` |
| `era_technique` | A dated production process rather than decade costume | `hand_painted_cel`, `early_digital_anime` |
| `detail_density` | Frequency and distribution of meaningful detail | `sparse`, `focal`, `uniform`, `dense` |
| `depth_finish` | Pictorial depth and polish, not scene-camera projection | `flat_graphic`, `overlap_depth`, `atmospheric`, `volumetric` |
| `affect` | Intended visual-emotional tendency | `kawaii`, `severe`, `dreamy`, `grotesque_cute` |
| `production_role` | Where the image is used | `cutscene_still`, `environment_background`, `item_icon` |
| `content` | Who or what is depicted | courier, forest, tool, costume, fantasy |
| `composition` | Framing, layout, camera, and pose | full shot, close-up, lateral view, seated pose |

The first nine axes define a style record. `affect` may modify that record, but
an affect word alone does not prove control of rendering style.
`production_role`, `content`, and `composition` are experiment controls or
application context.

Canonical IDs use `lower_snake_case`. Exact prompt spellings and aliases are
also retained because `SD`, `super-deformed`, and `chibi` may not produce the
same model behavior.

## Reviewed model-pair prompt gallery

- **Combined recorded experiment:** 151 calls, 138 successes, 13 failures, $15.710840 reported cost.
- **The 92 reviewed source outputs represented by gallery previews:** $9.454520 in sidecar-reported artifact cost; this is separate from the combined batch total because the gallery reuses earlier originals.
- **No-image evidence:** unchanged-prompt blocks and the Banner route failure are preserved in [`failure classification`](evidence/model-pair-failure-classification.json); the successful Banner fallback is preserved in [`aspect-fallback execution`](evidence/model-pair-aspect-fallback-execution.json).

### Surface treatment vocabulary

Surface treatment is independent of subject, composition, outline, and shape
language. These fields prevent a local hand-painted or tactile cue from becoming
an unintended full-frame vintage-paper treatment.

| Axis | Meaning | Default for game assets |
|---|---|---|
| `substrate` | The image plane or reproduction medium: digital raster, paper, canvas, or print. | `clean_digital_raster` |
| `texture_scope` | Where visible texture is allowed: none, object-local, region-local, or global overlay. | `object_local` |
| `material_condition` | Whether depicted materials read as clean, new, worn, weathered, or distressed. | `clean_stylized` |
| `microdetail_density` | The amount of grain, scratches, pores, fibers, and other fine surface information. | `simplified` |
| `color_age` | Whether color is fresh, muted, faded, sepia-aged, or chemically shifted. | `fresh` |
| `global_postprocess` | Image-wide grain, vignette, dust, scratches, faded wash, or another finishing overlay. | `none` |

The default contract is therefore a **clean digital raster with object-local texture**: texture may describe selected objects or painted boundaries, but the image plane itself stays clean. The four revised entries use this split instead of treating `gouache`, `ink`, or tactile materials as permission for global aging.

| natural fashion anatomy and an asymmetrical full-body technical silhouette | YES | YES |
| thin broken colored line with matte textured planar digital paint | YES | YES |
| desaturated industrial palette controlled by one small high-chroma accent | YES | YES |
| restrained operator-promotion hierarchy with generous negative space | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Natural fashion anatomy, an asymmetric technical coat, thin broken edges, matte planar texture, a single yellow accent, and controlled negative space preserve the restrained operator-promotion language.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The full-body operator remains isolated in a desaturated industrial field with fractured colored line, planar digital paint, one yellow pouch accent, and an asymmetric utility silhouette.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** Both reproduce the restrained industrial operator hierarchy; GPT is more semi-real, while Grok is closer to an anime-fashion character finish.

Give her an extremely intricate ceremonial costume combining layered silk, fitted armor, gold filigree, translucent ribbons, jewelry, and one oversized signature weapon. Surround her with a dense but controlled supernatural tableau: curling storm clouds, luminous lightning threads, scattered petals, magical seals, and fragments of a ruined celestial palace. Use precise Japanese collectible-card linework, polished cel-painted skin and fabric, selectively painterly effects, jewel-bright accents, and luminous edge lighting.

Show a clearly adult woman, age 25, sitting across from the viewer in a quiet academy archive after closing time. Frame the scene from intimate first-person conversational distance, as though the viewer has just entered a private shared moment. She pauses over an open notebook, meets the viewer's eyes, and gives a small emotionally specific smile. Add one thin floating geometric halo above her head, a tidy uniform-inspired jacket adapted as adult professional clothing, scattered stationery, a cooling drink, shelves, and late-afternoon window light. Use pristine modern anime linework, simple but expressive eyes, soft cel shading, pale bloom, cool blue shadows, warm sunlit skin, and restrained cinematic depth of field. Keep the environment calm and narratively meaningful rather than decorative. No interface, captions, logo, or existing character.

> Create a vertical premium support-card illustration for an original sports-training mobile game. Depict a clearly adult female sprinter, age 25, with horse ears and a matching tail, exploding from the final bend of a grass racetrack during a championship relay. Use an aggressive low trackside camera and strong foreshortening: one shoe drives toward the viewer, her torso twists forward, and her ponytail, jacket, race bib, and tail whip backward under speed. Show two competitors falling behind, a packed grandstand, flying turf, sunlight, and diagonal speed streaks. Render it as lavish television-anime key art with crisp contours, bright cel colors, selective gradient shading, highly expressive eyes, and polished environmental painting. The image should capture one decisive story beat rather than a generic runner portrait. No title, interface, readable sponsor text, logo, or existing character.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** The sole-first race climax, aggressive low-angle foreshortening, diagonal speed field, bright broadcast cel finish, horse traits, moving costume, and stadium ensemble read as an SSR support-card event image.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** A frozen sprint apex combines low lens distortion, diagonal track motion, vivid sports-anime cel rendering, horse ears and tail, uniform movement, and a crowded race context.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** Both strongly recognize the support-card surface; GPT uses a more extreme near-camera shoe and facial close-up, while Grok keeps the runner's full racing action clearer.

> Create a wide five-star acquisition splash for an original open-world elemental fantasy RPG. Center a clearly adult desert cartographer, age 30, turning through a graceful airborne combat pose while unfurling a crescent-shaped brass instrument that controls wind and sand. Build a sweeping circular composition from pale turquoise wind ribbons, amber sand, map fragments, feathers, and stylized cloud curls. Her ornate travel costume should combine layered cloth, fitted leather, gemstone accents, tassels, and a sharply readable silhouette. Use refined anime linework, softly modeled faces, painterly fantasy materials, luminous elemental gradients, and large areas of pale atmospheric negative space. The character, weapon, and elemental motif must remain immediately legible even amid the effects. Aim for optimistic high-fantasy elegance rather than dark realism. No interface, rarity stars, text, logo, mascot, or existing character.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: NO.** The circular elemental gesture, pale atmosphere, and unified desert-costume-weapon motif are present, but diffuse sepia watercolor dominates the character and misses the defining clean cel-painterly wish-splash finish.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Grok retains a cleaner outlined character inside a strong circular aqua-sand gesture, pale negative field, and tightly unified regional costume, crescent weapon, and elemental motif, narrowly preserving the wish-splash identity.

**Pair outcome: `GROK_ONLY`.**

**Comparison:** Both find the elemental composition, but GPT drifts into generic watercolor concept art; Grok's cleaner silhouette and cel-painterly character finish keep the anchored recruitment surface legible.

Use a deep midnight background interrupted by ivory panels, thin gold geometry, saturated burgundy fabric, cyan starlight, and tiny constellations.

Exaggerate the lens: huge foreground boot and tool, compact torso, sharply receding street. Surround her with cream-and-black comic panels, fluorescent orange warning shapes, cyan stickers, torn poster edges, halftone dots, speed arrows, and chunky graffiti marks, but include no readable words. Her outfit should mix workwear, street fashion, protective pads, dangling tags, and bold color blocking. Use crisp anime contours, thick graphic shadows, occasional dry-brush texture, posterized highlights, and a playful commercial attitude.

Behind him, suggest floating islands, weathered airship timber, pale clouds, distant rigging, and one enormous translucent bird formed from wind. Render the figure with delicate hand-inked contours, restrained old-school JRPG proportions, muted watercolor and gouache textures, warm parchment undertones, desaturated blues, and selective gold and crimson accents. Let feathers, rope, cloth, leaves, and clouds interlock into a dense decorative rhythm without losing the face or weapon.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: NO.** Delicate ink, parchment paint, feather-and-scarf motion, and muted blue-red accents are convincing, but the realistic western pirate anatomy reads as vintage fantasy concept art rather than classic anime-JRPG final-uncap art.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: NO.** The weathered parchment skyfarer tableau repeats the ink texture, natural motion, and restrained accents, yet its mature historical-illustration proportions again omit the anchor's anime character language.

**Pair outcome: `NEITHER`.**

A clearly adult female fire knight, age 32, has just completed a horizontal sword strike through a colossal armored demon. Freeze the instant before the explosion: her face and upper body occupy one side in sharp profile, the blade creates a brilliant diagonal across the frame, and the enemy silhouette breaks into black fragments on the other side. Use decisive animation contours, saturated red-orange fire, deep crushed shadows, white-hot impact shapes, motion smears, flying embers, and two or three simplified background planes. Preserve accurate anatomy and an unmistakable weapon arc while allowing effects to dominate the frame.

> Create a wide class-awakening promotional painting for an original dark-fantasy online RPG. Depict a clearly adult male mercenary, age 42, stepping from a wall of smoke while raising a newly awakened two-handed chain blade. Give him weathered features, powerful realistic anatomy, layered black leather, scarred steel plates, fur, buckles, and a torn crimson cloak. The weapon should dominate one diagonal, with links whipping through sparks and ash toward the viewer. Behind him, suggest a burning fortress, mounted silhouettes, storm clouds, and orange fire diffused through charcoal smoke. Render the face, armor, and weapon in sharply detailed semi-real digital painting, then dissolve the outer composition into rough brushwork, particles, fog, and backlight. The mood is brutal, prestigious, and physically grounded rather than anime-clean. No UI, title, logo, or existing class.

Draw every figure with black hand-inked outlines, pie-cut eyes, white gloves, rubber-hose limbs, squash-and-stretch curvature, and broad readable expressions. Paint the theater scenery in translucent watercolor washes over warm paper, with muted burgundy curtains, faded mint props, and ochre footlights. Add slight line boil, imperfect color registration, dust, fine film grain, subtle vignette, and gently uneven exposure, while keeping the principal silhouettes crisp enough for gameplay.

A small foxlike spirit made of soft white-blue light leaps between moss-covered roots above a dark reflecting pool. Surround it with enormous curved tree trunks, translucent leaves, luminous fungi, hanging seed pods, drifting motes, and a distant waterfall. Render the environment as richly layered digital painting rather than outlined cartoon art: near foliage nearly black and sharply silhouetted, middle layers saturated in turquoise and violet, and far layers softened into luminous mist. Let light bloom around the spirit, fungi, and water while retaining a clearly readable path of platforms. Use flowing organic shapes, jewel-like color, fine natural texture, and dramatic scale contrast.

Place a tiny armored astrologer at the center of a dark ruined plaza while hundreds of compact skeleton, bat, and slime sprites press inward from every edge. Surround the hero with overlapping automatic attacks: rotating silver blades, a pulsing emerald ring, diagonal lightning chains, falling amber meteors, and dense jewel-like experience shards. Keep the ground nearly flat and dark, patterned only with sparse cracked tiles and dead weeds, so the moving sprite field dominates.

| Warm practical lights contrasted against cool atmospheric shadows | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Sharp pixel travelers remain visibly separate from modeled snowbound scenery, with miniature foreground blur, bokeh, bloom, volumetric lamps, and warm windows against cobalt shadows.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Chunky pixel travelers cross a physically lit diorama bridge framed by shallow focus, falling snow, amber lamps, blue-hour depth, and strong foreground occlusion.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** GPT separates flat sprites more sharply; Grok integrates them slightly into the miniature lighting, yet both unmistakably reproduce the HD-2D diorama surface.

> Create an original 16:9 turn-based fantasy-RPG battle frame in polished, high-detail 16-bit-inspired pixel art. Three compact adventurer sprites face a giant moss-backed river crab on a circular tidal platform beneath a moonlit waterfall. Render every element—including characters, water, cliffs, plants, clouds, and spell effects—as deliberate pixel clusters with no smooth 3D geometry. Use generous sprite animation poses, expressive silhouettes, rich multi-step color ramps, sparkling reflected moonlight, and finely tiled environmental detail. A crescent-shaped turquoise spell should illuminate nearby surfaces while warm lanterns mark the party side. Compose the battlefield with a slightly elevated fixed camera and clear opposing formations. The result should feel like premium modern pixel craft rather than a literal low-resolution screenshot. No interface, text, logo, existing monster, or recognizable party design.

An adult flagellant knight wearing a tall bronze reliquary helm confronts a many-armed wax saint inside a ruined processional chapel. Render elaborate cracked tilework, twisted silver votives, heavy embroidered banners, candle racks, bone reliquaries, and distant bell arches with dense hand-placed pixel clusters. Use a restrained palette of umber stone, tarnished gold, dried crimson, corpse ivory, and deep black, interrupted by a single cold shaft of light. Give figures solemn, weighty silhouettes and anatomically readable attack poses; blood may appear as stylized rust-red pixel sprays rather than glossy realism.

> Primary request: Create an original night camp where a lanky botanist with triangular hair tends a tiny fire while a nervous pack animal and several long-legged shadow birds watch from beyond the light. Surround them with grass marks, thorn bushes, twisted bare trees, scattered stones, traps, and a crooked hand-built science device.
> Style and shape language: macabre digitally inked animation design; thin nervous contour lines; sparse repeated hatching clipped to characters, props, and selected grass marks; oversized heads; spindly limbs; separately readable puppet-like silhouette layers; deliberately imperfect perspective. Use muted olive, charcoal, bone, and dark burgundy, with fresh orange reserved for the campfire.
> Surface finish: contemporary clean game framebuffer. Use a smooth neutral digital ground beneath the drawn vegetation. The puppet construction is shape language only, without physical paper fibers. Texture is object-local only; the image plane remains clean.
> Composition: Keep the camp, character, pack animal, birds, traps, and science device clearly separated at gameplay scale.
> Constraints: no paper or canvas substrate, parchment color, full-frame grain, dust, scratches, stains, foxing, faded print wash, sepia filter, vignette, scanned-page appearance, interface, text, logo, existing survivor, or recognizable creature design.

Four exhausted adult adventurers—a shield bearer, grave physician, torch monk, and crossbow scout—stand in a compressed rank on the left, facing two swollen tunnel parasites on the right. Draw the scene with extremely heavy angular black inks, chipped contour edges, blocky anatomy, carved facial planes, and large areas of crushed shadow. Use a narrow palette of soot black, parchment beige, oxidized green, blood red, and dull gold. Light the characters from one low torch so their faces and equipment emerge in hard graphic wedges while the corridor disappears into darkness.

An exhausted middle-aged harbor inspector and a neatly dressed union archivist stand beside a broken public fountain in a wind-beaten coastal district. Surround them with peeling apartment walls, wet cobblestones, a shuttered kiosk, leaning utility poles, dead grass, distant cranes, and gray sea haze. Use an elevated oblique camera, but allow architectural edges to dissolve into brush marks and stained color rather than precise 3D geometry. Build the palette from bruised violet, oxidized teal, dirty ochre, nicotine yellow, and occasional hot magenta accents. Figures should remain small yet identifiable through posture and color blocks.

**Exact provider prompt shared byte-for-byte by both models**

> Use case: stylized-concept
> Asset type: small collectible-card artwork cropped for the illustration window, without the card frame.
> Primary request: Create an original goblin pastry alchemist accidentally launching a flaming berry pie across a busy workshop. The goblin has a huge expressive nose, color-blocked oven mitts, a flour-dusted clean leather apron, and a copper whisk-wand; the flying pie and the goblin's horrified delight form the central gag.
> Style and shape language: broad friendly caricature rather than realistic anatomy; oversized face, hands, eyebrows, and props; thick confident digital brush shapes; smooth matte color fields; rounded simplified materials. Differentiate clean copper, wood, glazed ceramic, dough, and smoke through silhouette, hue, and broad highlight shapes rather than realistic roughness. Use warm honey brown, clean gold, saturated berry red, and one turquoise magical accent.
> Surface finish: contemporary clean digital card-game illustration. Allow only one or two deliberate painted accents per object. Keep colors fresh and the image plane clean.
> Composition: Use a compact centered circular action readable at thumbnail size, with flour, sparks, and utensils framing but not obscuring the face.
> Constraints: no PBR rendering, photorealistic microdetail, patina, grime, scratches, chipped paint, paper or canvas texture, full-frame grain, sepia grading, brown edge wear, vignette, card border, text, icon, number, rarity gem, logo, copied fantasy character, horror, or distant scenic composition.

| Broad caricature with oversized face, hands, and readable expression | YES | YES |
| Rounded simplified materials described by broad digital brush masses rather than microtexture | YES | YES |
| Fresh warm tavern palette punctuated by one saturated magical color | YES | YES |
| Central comic action designed to survive a very small crop | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** The enormous goblin face, hands and mitt, fresh tavern-bakery palette, turquoise enchanted whisk, and compact flaming-pie accident read clearly at card size; broad clean brush masses replace the former PBR-like microtexture.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Grok preserves the oversized comic expression, rounded simplified props, warm workshop color, one cyan magical accent, and thumbnail-readable pie mishap with broad object-local painted blocking and no pervasive weathering.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** Both now control caricature, palette, broad brush handling, and the card-scale gag without the previous gritty material drift; GPT is the stronger overall replacement while Grok remains slightly flatter.

> Use case: narrative full-art illustration revealed from a digital collectible card.
> Asset type: full-width fantasy follower or spell artwork, without any card frame.
> Primary request: Show an original adult canal-city courier arriving one second too late to stop a forbidden relic from opening. The courier enters in a rain cape from the lower left; a frightened archivist recoils in the middle distance; an opened brass reliquary releases spectral birds toward the upper right. Include wet footprints, dropped sealing wax, and tilting shelves as small story clues.
> Style: sophisticated painterly fantasy illustration; believable adult anatomy; simplified but convincing architecture; crisp foreground silhouettes; carefully controlled atmospheric depth; teal canal light, oxidized copper, parchment cream, muted violet, and brilliant cyan reserved for the supernatural event.
> Composition: Stage a complete narrative incident rather than a posed hero poster. Keep the courier, relic, and spectral eruption readable at card size while letting distant areas soften into broad strokes.
> Constraints: no text, card frame, existing symbols, recognizable character, modern object, logo, interface, ornamental border, or generic single-character beauty pose.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Courier, archivist, opened reliquary, and spectral birds form a complete lore incident, with a coherent rain-dark regional palette, crisp foreground figures, softened city depth, and subordinate evidence props.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The intruder, alarmed scholar, spectral flock, scattered papers, books and rainbound archive stage a narrative card event rather than a beauty pose, with clear foreground silhouettes and painterly depth.

> Use case: premium borderless fantasy artwork for a digital collectible card.
> Asset type: vertical creature or planeswalker-style card painting, without typography or frame ornament.
> Primary request: Paint an original adult desert astronomer binding a fallen star inside a bronze astrolabe. She wears layered sun-bleached robes and practical leather gloves; her weathered face is lit by the captive star while rotating engraved rings form a symbolic halo above her.
> Style: serious classical representational fantasy painting; convincing adult anatomy, observed fabric folds, weathered skin, dense engraved metal, granular sandstone, and physically coherent firelight; restrained umber, ochre, charcoal, and tarnished green interrupted by one white-gold celestial focal point; depth built through value, temperature, and atmospheric dust rather than outlines.
> Composition: Place the figure slightly below center so the luminous star and astrolabe dominate the upper field. Make every ritual prop imply history while preserving a clear portrait-card silhouette.
> Constraints: no border, mana-like symbol, text, logo, contemporary technology, copied costume, glossy anime rendering, comic ink lines, game interface, or explosive action-poster pose.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Lineless classical anatomy, restrained desert earths, a single golden supernatural focus, solemn symbolic staging, and physically lit cloth, brass, parchment and stone reproduce borderless mythic card painting.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The aged astronomer is rendered without contour lines in a natural umber palette, holding one radiant gold armillary in a static symbolic ritual with coherent tactile cloth, metal and ruin lighting.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** GPT adds more surrounding ritual objects and atmospheric depth; Grok simplifies the icon, with equally specific borderless fantasy-card realism.

Her ribbons, antennae, leaves, and crescent ornaments should repeat one coherent botanical motif.
> Style: elongated fashion-illustration silhouette; delicate animation-like facial and shape design combined with softly painted volume; simplified anatomy, jewel-like eyes, brushed fabric gradients, ornate botanical filigree, and graceful Art Nouveau curves; dusty lavender, midnight blue, bone ivory, and small luminous mint accents.
> Composition: Show the complete uncropped figure and feet. Frame the body with decorative curves and a shallow faded moon disc, mist, and flat foliage arabesques rather than a deep scene.
> Constraints: no text, interface, faction emblem, copied costume, recognizable wings, cropped feet, gritty realism, photorealistic texture, battle scene, or unrelated ornamental clutter.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** The extremely elongated full-body collection pose, repeated Art Nouveau leaf and moth curves, cel-shaped costume masses with soft gradients, and limited moonlit faction palette establish an ascended hero portrait.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** A long fashion-illustration silhouette, repeated crescent and botanical curves, clean cel-shaped garment planes softened by gradients, and a shallow lavender ornamental field retain the registered ascended collection surface.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** GPT is denser and more East-Asian-gacha ornate; Grok is flatter and closer to a collection portrait, while both meet the specific Art Nouveau silhouette grammar.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** The tiny gingerbread body, chocolate-brown contour, flat candy color, shallow glossy shading, telescope prop and dense circular star burst unmistakably form a cookie-character acquisition splash.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Grok uses the same compressed cookie construction, thick edible-brown outline, bright flat confectionery palette, minimal depth, and circular starburst reveal around the featured character.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Near-spherical limbless birds, severe eyebrow-and-beak acting, smooth vector-like gradients, and a single left-to-right pear confrontation create an immediately readable casual loading-screen gag.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The round primary-color birds, minimal anatomy, exaggerated angry brows, toy-polish shading, and frightened burrowers organized around the stolen pears retain every ensemble marker.

Show the complete plant in a clear three-quarter view with an oversized mouth, tiny suspicious eyes, uneven thorns, broad leaf-feet, and one ridiculous improvised accessory: a loose suburban garden-hose strap.
> Style and shape language: clean modern mobile-game cartoon rendering; lumpy asymmetrical silhouette; thick dark outlines with slight weight variation; flat saturated yellow-green and turquoise color fields; one smooth controlled gradient per form; small hard highlights. Express the mildly grotesque botanical quality through lobes, uneven thorns, and three or four deliberate pores, not through surface dirt or noise.
> Surface finish: contemporary clean digital game raster. Use clean unblemished plant skin and clean stylized brass without oxidation. Texture is sparse and object-local only.
> Composition: Make the functional joke obvious immediately. Ground the character with one small oval shadow and only a softly blurred clean fence and lawn behind it.
> Constraints: no mottled skin, stippled fill, watercolor granulation, patina, corrosion, grime, scratches, chipped finish, paper or canvas texture, global grain, faded or olive color wash, vignette, typography, stats, interface frame, realistic botanical rendering, known unit design, zombie, copied weapon, complex environment, photorealism, or multiple characters.

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** A clean lumpy anthropomorphic cactus is built around an enormous polished horn, with asymmetrical spikes, thick contour, saturated fills, controlled gradients, and an absurd hose-and-clamp garden contraption; no patina or surface mottling remains.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The clean irregular plant, oversized polished brass nozzle, annoyed face, strong outline, simple saturated volume, and wrapped household hose reproduce an almanac unit portrait without weathering or global texture.

Give every fighter a distinct oversized silhouette and readable emotional reaction.
> Style: huge heads, hands, footwear, and props; torsos and joints simplified into rounded sculpted masses; smooth colorful 3D-like shading; crisp edges; flat graphic dust clouds and starburst impacts; saturated cyan, magenta, and orange lighting.
> Composition: Arrange a clear action triangle with one foreground impact, one airborne figure, and one reacting figure. Keep the environment bold but shallow enough for phone-screen readability.
> Constraints: no words, logo, interface, copied weapon, recognizable character, realistic anatomy, detailed crowd, photorealism, gore, or visually equal background figures.

| Registered visible style marker | GPT Image 2 | Grok Image 2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Huge heads hands shoes and signature props on compressed bodies | YES | YES |
| Three-character triangular action composition | YES | YES |
| Smooth 3D-like shading combined with flat graphic impact effects | YES | YES |
| Saturated complementary lighting and shallow phone-readable depth | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Three compressed fighters with huge hands, shoes and tools form a strong triangle around a flat impact burst, using smooth 3D shading, saturated cyan-magenta-orange light and shallow carnival depth.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** The oversized hammer, wrench, wheel and heads, triangular three-fighter staging, graphic ground hit, smooth toy shading and neon amusement-park palette reproduce a phone-readable seasonal loading illustration.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** GPT pushes more cinematic foreshortening; Grok gives the three-character triangle a cleaner read, with equivalent seasonal-loading style control.

#### `rayman_gouache_platformer_world_v1`

**Real-hit anchor:** [Rayman Legends](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/our-brands/rayman)<br>
**Reference surface:** Playable hand-painted side-scrolling level vista<br>
**Shared prompt SHA-256:** `632e5e4f7852c8c49b0966e59162b9d22adbdbd569e20f7429239802115b8785`<br>

**Effective output aspects:** GPT Image 2 `16:9`; Grok Image 2 `16:9`<br>
**Model routes:** `openai/gpt-image-2` and `x-ai/grok-imagine-image-2.0`

**Exact provider prompt shared byte-for-byte by both models**

> Use case: stylized-concept
> Asset type: wide playable 2D side-scrolling level vista showing character scale, foreground footing, hazards, and a readable traversal route.
> Primary request: Set the level inside an enormous overgrown music box. Show an original limbless blue courier leaping from a felt piano hammer toward a rotating brass drum, with floating gloves and shoes clearly separated from the body. Mechanical flowers, curled vines, bellows, and music-box teeth create the path.
> Style and shape language: clean contemporary digitally painted 2D platformer art; gouache-like opaque color blocking rendered digitally; cut-paper-inspired silhouette layering without paper fibers; soft matte shadows; clean saturated color fields; deliberately irregular shape contours without fraying; decorative curls; richly colored mechanical foliage; elastic animation logic. Use plum, moss green, turquoise, and clean warm brass with spotlight-like pools guiding movement.
> Surface finish: polished modern game framebuffer. Material texture may appear only inside the specific felt, brass, leaf, and flower surfaces. Keep brass clean and stylized rather than tarnished. Keep the image plane perfectly clean.
> Composition: Establish a dark foreground silhouette for playable footing, a saturated middle layer containing hazards and pickups, and two progressively softer parallax backgrounds. Make the route travel clearly left to right.
> Constraints: no paper, canvas, or felt substrate across the frame; no full-frame grain, rubbed-pigment noise, frayed fibers, age stains, faded wash, sepia cast, tarnish overlay, vignette, scanned illustration, photographed craft diorama, interface, text, logo, photorealistic machinery, sterile straight-edged geometry, existing hero costume, purely scenic composition, hidden route, 3D-rendered materials, or realistic human anatomy.

| Registered visible style marker | GPT Image 2 | Grok Image 2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Digitally rendered gouache-like color blocking and irregular silhouette edges without paper fibers | YES | YES |
| Elastic character and environmental shapes | YES | YES |
| Strong foreground gameplay and parallax-depth layer separation | YES | YES |
| Decorative readable traversal route with object-local texture and a clean image plane | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** Clean digitally rendered opaque color blocks, elastic floating limbs and machinery, dark foreground curls, saturated gameplay ledges, and separated parallax depth create a decorative traversable platform world without a global craft-paper substrate.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Clean irregular silhouette layers, detached elastic hands and shoes, restrained object-local texture, strong foreground-to-backdrop separation, and an exposed sequence of platforms and hazards retain all four side-scroller markers.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** Both remove the previous all-over paper and rubbed-pigment treatment: GPT is richer and more scenic, while Grok gives the cleanest and most route-explicit gameplay frame.

**Surface-finish revision:** The displayed GPT Image 2 and Grok Image 2 files are the accepted clean-digital revision originals. The earlier pair remains historical execution evidence and is not embedded.

**Effective output aspects:** GPT Image 2 `21:9`; Grok Image 2 `16:9`<br>
**Model routes:** `openai/gpt-image-2` and `x-ai/grok-imagine-image-2.0`

**Exact provider prompt shared byte-for-byte by both models**

> Use case: story-map travel panorama for a solemn 2D tactical role-playing game.
> Asset type: ultrawide caravan landscape with small marching figures, not tactical combat or dialogue portrait art.
> Primary request: Show an original column of refugees crossing a frozen red-grass valley beneath three monumental stone arches. The travelers occupy only the lower tenth of the frame as small dark figures with angular cloaks, wagons, horned pack animals, and one tall plain banner, emphasizing the hostile scale of the land.
> Style: flattened mid-century animation-background design; hard-edged mountain shapes, elegant tapering trees, long horizontal snow bands, restrained surface texture, muted slate blue, weathered cream, oxblood red, charcoal, and a pale low sun producing simple graphic shadows; decisive figure contours with distant terrain kept largely lineless and shape-driven.
> Composition: Use monumental horizontal bands and ample negative sky. Maintain clear left-to-right procession and an emotion of solemn endurance rather than heroic combat.
> Constraints: no text, logo, interface, grid, specific cultural symbol, copied costume, glossy rendering, detailed faces, modern equipment, atmospheric photorealism, or fantasy spectacle effects.

| Registered visible style marker | GPT Image 2 | Grok Image 2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Tiny caravan contrasted against monumental horizontal landscape | YES | YES |
| Flattened hard-edged mid-century background shapes | YES | YES |
| Muted Nordic palette with one recurring banner accent color | YES | YES |
| Decisive figure contours but largely lineless distant terrain | YES | YES |

**GPT Image 2 verdict: YES.** A minute dark caravan crosses a monumental ultra-wide snowfield under hard-edged flattened arches, muted blue-gray and ivory planes, one oxblood banner, crisp figures and lineless distant terrain.

**Grok Image 2 verdict: YES.** Tiny silhouetted travelers and wagons remain subordinate to austere geometric mountains and arches, using a muted Nordic palette, one red banner accent, decisive figure contours and flat distant shapes.

**Pair outcome: `BOTH`.**

**Comparison:** GPT sustains the more monumental 21:9 scale; Grok's 16:9 fallback compresses the panorama but does not materially weaken the caravan-to-landscape contrast or flattened shape language.

**Aspect-fallback note:** GPT returned the requested `21:9`. Grok exhausted the unchanged prompt at `21:9`, then returned the reviewed source output represented by the preview at `16:9`. The prompt stayed byte-identical; only the output aspect changed. See [`failure classification`](evidence/model-pair-failure-classification.json) and [`aspect-fallback execution`](evidence/model-pair-aspect-fallback-execution.json).

**Evidence:** [`current paired profiles`](evidence/model-pair-profiles.json), [`validated original manifest`](evidence/model-pair-manifest.json), and [`independent category review`](evidence/model-pair-review-western.json).

### Reading the outcomes

- `BOTH`: both models made the registered style recognizable.
- `GPT_ONLY`: GPT Image 2 made it recognizable; Grok Image 2 did not.
- `GROK_ONLY`: Grok Image 2 made it recognizable; GPT Image 2 either did not
  or returned no image. The entry and index distinguish `NO` from `BLOCKED`.
- `NEITHER`: neither model made the registered style recognizable.
- `BLOCKED` is not a style-recognition verdict. For aggregate pair outcomes only,
  a blocked output occupies the false side while remaining explicitly labeled.

A model verdict applies only to the exact prompt, prompt hash, effective aspect
ratio, route, and reviewed originals recorded here. It does not claim ownership
of a game's visual identity or authorize redistribution of game artwork. This
gallery contains generated originals, not copies of the linked reference art.

## Candidate keyword inventory

All candidates below start with evidence status `untested`. Priority values mean:
`high`, `medium`, or `low` test value; `control` for an intentionally broad
baseline; `context` for a non-style term that should remain fixed; `reject` for
a term that is already unsuitable as a canonical style ID; and `restricted`
for a term that needs extra safety, cultural, or rights review. None of these
priority values claims model recognition.

Priority is also separate from eligibility. Each tested record receives one
hard `term_kind`:

- `style_candidate`: a visible medium, line, shading, color, surface, or
  character-grammar control that may enter atomic testing;
- `diagnostic_label`: an umbrella, demographic, market, affective, or cultural
  shorthand worth probing for model behavior but not canonicalizing without
  decomposition;
- `context_only`: a production role, genre, subject, layout, camera, or pose;
  and
- `reject`: unsafe, product-derived, incoherent, or irrelevant vocabulary.

Only `style_candidate` enters the atomic promotion path. A high-priority
`diagnostic_label` may reveal a useful or stereotyped model association, while a
high-priority `context_only` term may expose a confound; neither is thereby a
style control.

### Contemporary Japanese illustration and publishing labels

| Candidate keyword or alias | Primary class | Expected signal or reason to test | Priority |

| `yume-kawaii` | affect/aesthetic compound | Dreamy pastel cute; likely fashion and mood leakage | low |
| `yami-kawaii` | affect/aesthetic compound | Cute-dark shorthand; safety-sensitive motif leakage makes it non-priority | restricted |
| `bishoujo`, `bishōjo` | market/character archetype | Attractive feminine character category, not a rendering style; any diagnostic test requires a clearly adult fixed subject | context |
| `bishounen`, `bishōnen` | market/character archetype | Elegant or androgynous masculine character category, not a rendering style; any diagnostic test requires a clearly adult fixed subject | context |
| `chibi` | character-design grammar | Large head, compact body, simplified extremities and features | high |

| `visual novel illustration` | production dialect | Polished character-focused game illustration; broad | high |
| `visual novel character sprite`, `tachie` | production role/dialect | Standing character treatment; layout is not style | context |
| `visual novel event CG`, `event CG` | production role/dialect | Narrative still role; polish and composition do not define a style | context |
| `light novel illustration` | publishing dialect | Character-led polished illustration with white-space or cover/interior conventions | high |
| `otome game illustration` | market/production dialect | Refined character presentation; may change subject and framing | high |
| `anime key visual` | production role/dialect | Ensemble or promotional finish; layout-heavy | medium |
| `anime film background` | production role/dialect | Environment role; test explicit paint, depth-plane, and surface facets instead | context |
| `mobile RPG character illustration` | market/production dialect | High-finish game character rendering; broad and trend-sensitive | high |
| `mobile game card illustration`, `gacha card art` | market/production dialect | Card role and monetization context; dense effects or framing would be role leakage | context |

| `doujinshi` | publishing mode | Self-publishing category, not style | reject |
| `sakuga` | animation craft | Motion/performance term, not a still-image style | reject |

`Moe` stays in the inventory because users and models may employ it as a visual
shorthand, but research describes it primarily as a response to fictional
characters rather than one fixed style. The experiment must therefore test the
bare word and a separately authored observable-trait expansion. A bare-word
success would establish model behavior, not settle the cultural definition.

`Webtoon` must not be promoted as a style merely because a model emits a
vertical comic. Full color and vertical scrolling are common production
conventions, not universal requirements; any claimed rendering dialect needs
separate visible evidence.

notes as an alias for model-diagnostic research, but repository prompts and
canonical profiles use `stencil duplicator print`, `stencil print grain`, and
`multi-pass print misregistration` instead.

### Character proportion, face, and shape-language keywords

These affect style strongly but apply primarily to characters. They should not
be used to judge environment-only transfer.

  `volumetric depth`, `layered theatrical depth`.
- Optical treatment: `no blur`, `soft focus`, `dreamy bloom`, `vignette`,
  `chromatic fringe`, `depth-of-field effect`, `motion smear`. These must not be
  confused with runtime camera or animation behavior.

### Art-history and design-movement keywords

These can be productive for cutscenes, environments, cards, UI, or promotional
art. They remain historically broad and should be paired with visible traits
rather than treated as magic words.

- Decorative and graphic: `Art Nouveau`, `Jugendstil`, `Art Deco`, `Arts and
  Crafts`, `Bauhaus`, `Constructivist`, `De Stijl`, `Suprematist`, `Futurist`,
  `Op Art`, `Pop Art`, `Psychedelic poster`, `mid-century modern`, `brutalist

  `Rococo`, `Baroque`, `Neoclassical`, `Pre-Raphaelite`, `naive art`, `folk
  modernist`.
- Narrative and manuscript: `medieval illuminated manuscript`, `Byzantine icon`,
  `Persian miniature`, `Mughal miniature`, `Indian miniature painting`,
  `Ethiopian manuscript illumination`, `folk woodcut`, `paper theater`,
  `shadow-puppet`, `storybook engraving`.
- Folk and regional traditions requiring careful cultural review: `Mithila
  painting`, `Madhubani painting`, `Warli painting`, `Pattachitra`, `Kalamkari`,
  `Korean minhwa`, `Mexican retablo`, `papel picado`, `Dong Ho woodblock print`,
  `Chinese paper-cut`, `Japanese kirie`.

Heritage terms may carry subject, religious, ceremonial, or geographic meaning
that cannot be reduced to surface decoration. They require stronger sourcing
and review before canonical use.

### Aesthetic and story bundles that must remain contextual

The following words can create visually obvious changes, but they mix genre,
setting, fashion, mood, palette, and props. They are useful content direction,
not clean style controls:

`whimsical fantasy`, `heroic fantasy`, `dark fantasy`, `cozy fantasy`, `gothic
fantasy`, `fairy-tale`, `storybook fantasy`, `science fantasy`, `steampunk`,
`dieselpunk`, `cyberpunk`, `solarpunk`, `biopunk`, `retrofuturism`, `Afrofuturism`,
`cottagecore`, `fairycore`, `dreamcore`, `weirdcore`, `vaporwave`, `synthwave`,
`Y2K`, `dark academia`, `pastel goth`, `gothic`, `cute`, `cool`, `cinematic`,
`beautiful`, `stylized`, `premium`, `high quality`.

The quality fillers at the end should not enter canonical style records.

### Production-role vocabulary kept outside style

The experiment must name a role explicitly without treating it as style:

- Character and dialogue: `standing character illustration`, `tachie`,
  `dialogue portrait`, `bust portrait`, `visual-novel character sprite`,
  `expression portrait`, `cut-in illustration`, `UI portrait`, `avatar icon`,
  `paper-doll layer`, `costume layer`.
- Narrative and promotional: `event illustration`, `event CG`, `story still`,
  `cutscene still`, `anime key visual`, `promotional key art`, `gacha splash
  illustration`, `collectible-card illustration`, `loading-screen
  illustration`, `light-novel cover illustration`, `light-novel interior
  illustration`, `chapter illustration`.
- World and objects: `background painting`, `environment illustration`,
  `visual-novel background`, `parallax background`, `prop illustration`, `item
  card`, `inventory icon`, `skill icon`, `quest illustration`, `map
  illustration`, `tileable texture`, `decorative UI frame`, `emblem`, `badge`,
  `sticker`.
- Production sheets: `character sheet`, `model sheet`, `expression sheet`,
  `effect sheet`, `asset sheet`, `pixel sprite`, `sprite sheet`, `storyboard
  frame`, `animatic frame`.

Ambiguous words must be expanded in records: `sprite` can mean a pixel asset or
a visual-novel standing character; `CG` can mean computer graphics generally or
a visual-novel event illustration; `key visual` and `key art` are roles; `SD`
has several technical meanings.

## Terms excluded from canonical style records

- Geography alone: `Japanese`, `Chinese`, `Korean`, `Asian`, `East Asian`.
- Generic medium alone: `2D`, `digital art`, `illustration`, `anime`, `manga`.
- Business or platform tier: `mobile game`, `AAA`, `indie`, `premium`.
- Story genre alone: `romance`, `action`, `horror`, `fantasy`, `science fiction`,
  `isekai`, `wuxia`, `xianxia`.
- Subject or archetype alone: `samurai`, `shrine maiden`, `magical girl`,
  `idol`, `mecha`, `yokai`, `kemono`, `kemonomimi`, `ikemen`.
- Composition or pose: `full body`, `close-up`, `three-quarter view`,
  `isometric`, `Dutch angle`, `attack pose`, `running`, `neutral pose`.
- Release or animation craft: `OVA`, `sakuga`.
- Quality filler: `masterpiece`, `best quality`, `official art`, `trending`.
- Any named living artist, studio, franchise, character, game, proprietary asset
  pack, or `in the style of ...` construction.

`Photorealistic`, `live-action`, `cinematic photography`, and `realistic 3D
render` are retained only as optional boundary controls. They are not part of
the initial 2D-game illustration queue.

## Concept-to-asset style-retention track

The prompt gallery above tests exact model-pair outputs. This separate retention
track tests whether a neutral descriptor profile carries from concept to focused
assets through this chain:

```text
commercially proven 2D game research anchor
    -> neutral, observable descriptor profile D
    -> original concept scene C
    -> focused character, prop, or background asset E
    -> blinded consistency and control verdict
```

The intended claim is deliberately narrow: under the recorded model and date,
an exact neutral descriptor profile controlled an original concept and helped
retain the same visual language in a focused derivative asset. Four links must
be evaluated separately:

- `D -> C`: the concept expresses the pre-registered descriptors;
- `C -> E`: the focused asset preserves the selected content identity;
- `D -> E`: the focused asset independently expresses the descriptors; and
- `C <-> E`: reviewers judge both artifacts compatible with one original game
  art bible.

A famous game can be a factual research anchor, but it is not an admissible
generation keyword in this repository. A game name may appear in human-facing
research metadata and anchor IDs, but it must not appear in a provider prompt,
model-facing style descriptor, provider metadata, or submitted reference image.
Screenshots and other proprietary game art are not submitted to the model. This
follows the repository's [OSS and IP policy](../../docs/oss-ip.md) and means this
lab does **not** claim to test whether a model recognizes a named game directly.
It tests the more reusable and redistributable descriptor set derived from
observation.

### Commercial research-anchor cohort

This cohort is a purposive style-coverage sample, not a universal sales ranking.
Unit sales, players, downloads, revenue, awards, and cultural prominence are
different evidence types and must never be combined into one leaderboard. A
game enters the primary cohort only when:

1. a developer, publisher, platform owner, audited filing, or strong secondary
   report supports its commercial or iconic significance;
2. 2D or 2D-dominant art materially defines its player-facing presentation;
3. its observable treatment adds a useful contrast to the cohort; and
4. at least two analysts independently code its style facets and reconcile
   disagreements.

Each anchor records:

```text
research_anchor_id
game_name
anchor_version_or_asset_family
evidence_type
evidence_value
evidence_as_of
evidence_source
2d_relevance
observed_asset_roles
line_facets
shading_facets
color_facets
surface_facets
character_grammar
analyst_1
analyst_2
agreement_notes
neutral_profile_id
```

The initial sourced cohort and its analyst-coded profiles appear below; the
experiment protocol follows them. Commercial evidence proves only that an
anchor is worth studying; the neutral facet descriptions are analyst
observations, not claims made by the cited sales source.

The following research pool is intentionally broader than the first generation
wave. Every candidate profile remains `untested`.

Two independent desk-research passes were reconciled into this pool. That is
enough to propose experiments, not to promote a profile. Before generation,
the record must still pin the exact game version and asset family, preserve the
two analyst notes, and resolve any remaining facet disagreement.

Two commercially important cases are held outside the first profile wave:

- **Fate/Grand Order** is a counterexample to the assumption that a successful
  game has one illustration style. Its [official character gallery](https://fate-go.us/servant/)
  credits many illustrators. A valid test would track one newly designed
  original character from full art to portrait, battle sprite, and icon; it
  must not invent a franchise-wide house renderer.
- **Persona 5 series** has [13 million blended units/downloads as of March
  2025](https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/individual/business/), but its
  combined palette, collage geometry, typography, and brush-edged silhouettes
  create a protected-similarity risk. It remains a graphic-system research
  anchor, not a generation profile, until a neutral decomposition clearly
  avoids trade dress.

The first proof wave is deliberately only five profiles whose same global
descriptor bundle can be applied fairly to a scene, character, prop, and
background. Role-system hybrids move to a later translation wave.

| Order | Profile ID | Exact frozen descriptor bundle for the exploratory run | Nearest contrast | Primary transfers | 2026-08-24 result |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `constrained_low_resolution_pixel_v1` | `low-resolution pixel art; limited sixteen-color palette; one-pixel dark contours; clustered two-step shading; no gradients or antialiasing` | `luminous_highres_pixel_v1` | character, prop, background tile | `exploratory`; stopped at production-pixel gate |
| 2 | `flat_bold_cartoon_v1` | `heavy dark contour; flat saturated colors; sparse one-band cel shading; compact geometric proportions; clean vector-like edges` | `clean_cel_portrait_v1` | character, prop, background plate | `exploratory`; stopped at concept content gate |
| 3 | `inked_atmospheric_2d_v1` | `smooth dark hand-drawn contour; pale focal values; restrained low-saturation palette; soft modeled shading; layered atmospheric depth` | `flat_bold_cartoon_v1` | character, relic prop, background plate | `chain_reviewed`; `recognized_cross_role`; `reference_dominant` |
| 4 | `luminous_highres_pixel_v1` | `high-resolution pixel-rendered 2D; decisive silhouette; dense clustered texture; saturated emissive accents; strong depth-value separation` | `constrained_low_resolution_pixel_v1` | character, prop, effect, background module | `exploratory`; stopped at production-pixel gate |
| 5 | `modern_dense_pixel_v1` | `modern detail-dense pixel art; crisp pixel clusters; selective outlines; saturated local palettes; compact banded shading` | `warm_tile_pixel_v1` | character, tool, tile, layered background | `exploratory`; stopped at production-pixel and content gates |

The first row answers the user's “8-bit pixel game” example without pretending
that `8-bit` alone is a precise technical specification. Its acceptance gate is
the explicit grid, palette, contour, cluster, gradient, and antialiasing bundle.
The game name is not part of the frozen descriptor string.

The later translation wave contains `compact_bright_pixel_v1`,
`clean_cel_portrait_v1`, `dense_fantasy_unit_v1`, and
`dimensional_pixel_translation_v1`. Those systems intentionally change detail,
surface, framing, or depth treatment between roles. They use a stable global
profile plus pre-registered role facets rather than pretending that identical
surface treatment across all assets is the desired result. Balatro remains in
a separate `card_ui` track.

### From anchor observations to a neutral profile

Each profile contains at most one term from each orthogonal axis: line,
shading, color/value, surface/medium, and character grammar when applicable.
Composition, camera, genre, costume, setting, ethnicity, and asset role stay in
the content brief. The profile is rejected or rewritten if it:

- names or implies a game, franchise, character, artist, or studio;
- depends on protected iconography or trade dress;
- merely restates a production role such as `card art` or `cutscene`;
- bundles contradictory or unreviewable adjectives; or
- cannot be translated into three to five visible acceptance traits.

The exact spelling and term order are frozen for a run. A successful multi-term
profile proves control by that bundle. It does not establish that every word in
the bundle contributes; leave-one-term-out and atomic tests are required for
that stronger claim.

## End-to-end experiment

### Model scope

Model awareness is scoped to the exact provider, reported model ID, endpoint,
parameters, and test date. It is not permanent and cannot be projected onto
future model revisions. The first OpenRouter series requested
`openai/gpt-image-2`, but its buffered responses did not report a model ID. The
evidence therefore separates the requested model, authenticated endpoint ID,
and response-reported model. If the response identity cannot be established,
the run cannot be promoted as model-specific evidence.

### Original concept carrier

The same original semantic fixture is used across profiles. It contains a
character, a distinctive prop, and a reusable environment without using mood,
pose, or camera as the style signal:

```text
Create an original 2D game scene in even diffuse daylight. Show one clearly
adult field cartographer beside a small freestanding weather station. The
cartographer wears a teal coat and tan satchel. A round brass compass with one
triangular blue enamel mark rests on a plain worktable. Behind them are a low
stone shelter, three rounded hills, and a single narrow tree. Keep every named
element visible and spatially separate. Do not include words, letters, numbers,
logos, signatures, watermarks, borders, existing characters, or recognizable
franchise elements.

Style profile, preserve exactly: [EXACT NEUTRAL DESCRIPTOR PROFILE].
```

The brief controls nuisance variables but does not make pose accuracy the
research question. A profile may require another fixture only when its declared
scope excludes a scene carrier; that exception is pre-registered and cannot be
used to rescue a failed result.

Pixel runs also pre-register a nominal authoring grid and integer display scale.
The first run uses a `320 x 180` concept grid, a `48 x 64` character grid, a
`32 x 32` prop grid, and nearest-neighbor display scaling. These are technical
controls outside the style keyword block. If the provider cannot honor them,
the output can still be reviewed as `pixel_look_only` but cannot pass the
production-pixel gate.

### Wave-batched execution

A wave is the scheduling unit; each profile remains its own evidence and gate
unit. Before generation, freeze a wave manifest containing every admitted
profile, its exact descriptor bundle, expected visible traits, nearest contrast,
known confounds, applicable roles, prompt digests, required arms and sample
counts, and provider/model/settings. Run equivalent arms across the wave in a
balanced round-robin or randomized order. Do not reuse an artifact or control
arm across profile records.

OpenRouter's asynchronous Batch API is not used because it does not support
image-output jobs. Distinct prompts use independent synchronous image requests
with bounded client-side concurrency. The model's `n` parameter is only a
same-prompt variation count; it does not replace distinct arm records. The
image-generation component remains the sole retry owner for each request.

Review and advancement remain profile-local. Each profile receives its own
controls and independent review. Only a profile that passes Phase A, binds the
selected concept's SHA-256, and satisfies its pre-registered content, safety,
style, and technical gates may enter Phase B. A failed profile stops before
extraction without blocking unrelated profiles; a shared provider, model, or
settings change invalidates or splits the wave. Close the wave only after every
profile records an `advance`, `stop`, or `invalidated` decision. Batching changes
scheduling only, never controls, sample counts, blinding, evidence thresholds,
the extraction gate, or promotion requirements.

### Phase A: concept control

Before generation, register the profile, three to five expected visible traits,
one nearest contrast profile, likely confounds, and applicable asset roles.
Generate balanced arms:

| Arm | Prompt difference | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C0` | No style block | Stochastic and content baseline |
| `CT` | Exact target profile | Target concept control |
| `CN` | Exact nearest-neighbor profile | Specificity rather than generic styling |
| `CP` | Unrelated neutral profile, optional | Generic response to receiving any style block |

One output per arm is a stop/go screen only. Confirmation requires four fresh
outputs per required arm. A target profile is `concept_distinct` only when at
least three of four target outputs show its signatures, blinded target
assignment is at least 75%, target-versus-neighbor forced choice is at least
70%, and content, pose, costume, or layout leakage does not explain the result.

Select the source concept using a content-only rule: the first `CT` output that
passes named-element, text, safety, and technical checks. Do not select the
prettiest or most stylistically exaggerated result. Record its SHA-256 digest;
every derivative record binds to that exact concept.

If `CT` fails concept review, stop that profile. Extraction cannot repair a
concept miss and does not count as another provider retry.

### Phase B: concept-derived focused assets

The applicable targets are:

- **Character:** the same adult cartographer with the teal coat and tan satchel,
  complete readable silhouette, no added accessories, no text.
- **Prop:** the same round brass compass and triangular blue enamel mark,
  isolated and unobscured, no text or frame.
- **Background:** the same stone shelter, three hills, and narrow tree, with the
  character, worktable, and compass removed.

Not every style or game use requires an actor. An anchor may pre-register only
prop and background extraction, but every claimed cross-role profile must test
at least two applicable roles.

For each role, generate these arms while holding content facts, role,
dimensions, provider/model, and settings constant:

| Arm | Concept reference | Style block | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RK` | Exact selected concept | Exact same profile | Intended reference-plus-keyword chain |
| `R0` | Exact selected concept | None | Continuity supplied by reference alone |
| `0K` | None | Exact same profile | Keyword portability without visual reference |
| `RN` | Exact selected concept | Nearest contrast profile | Whether descriptors can steer against the reference |

The `0K` arm receives the same textual identity facts, not an image. The `RN`
arm changes only the style block. One fresh output per arm is exploratory;
promotion evidence requires at least three per arm and three independent
reviewers. A later leave-one-term-out study is run only for profiles that
survive the main chain.

### Phase C: blinded review

Two panels answer different questions:

1. **Concept classification.** Reviewers see randomized `C0`, `CT`, and `CN`
   artifacts without prompts, arm labels, or game anchors. They assign target,
   neighbor, or neutral and explain the visible evidence.
2. **Style consistency.** Reviewers see the selected concept and coded focused
   assets without prompts, keywords, or arm labels. They score the facets below
   and answer: “Which asset looks most likely to belong to the same original
   game art bible as the concept?”

Each dimension is scored `0`, `1`, or `2`:

| Dimension | `0` | `1` | `2` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Line-language continuity | Incompatible | Mixed | Clearly shared |
| Shading continuity | Incompatible | Mixed | Clearly shared |
| Palette/value continuity | Incompatible | Mixed | Clearly shared |
| Surface/medium continuity | Incompatible | Mixed | Clearly shared |
| Detail-density continuity | Incompatible | Mixed | Clearly shared |
| Character grammar, if applicable | Incompatible | Partial | Clearly shared |
| Content identity | Wrong subject | Approximate | Defining details preserved |
| Role usability | Unusable | Conditional | Readable for declared role |
| Protected-similarity cleanliness | Recognizable leakage | Questionable | Original and clean |

Scores do not replace a short visible-trait explanation. Preserve randomized
mappings and individual reviews, not only consensus.

### How to interpret the control arms

- `RK > R0`, `RK > 0K`, and `RK > RN`: reference and descriptors cooperate.
- `RK ~= R0`, while `RN` differs: reference is sufficient; descriptors add
  little continuity but can steer.
- `RK ~= R0 ~= RN`: reference dominates; descriptor contribution is unproven.
- `RK ~= 0K`, with identity loss in `0K`: descriptors are portable and the
  reference mainly preserves identity.
- `0K` preserves style but not identity: expected keyword-only behavior.
- `RN` equals or beats `RK`: control inversion; same-profile consistency is not
  demonstrated.
- one role fails while the others pass: role-scoped drift, not global control.

### Style-specific technical gates

Visual similarity and production validity are separate. Relevant additional
gates include:

- **Pixel profiles:** deliberate stable pixel grid, consistent effective pixel
  size between concept and extraction, coherent clusters, palette discipline,
  controlled dithering, and no accidental interpolation or antialiasing. A
  high-resolution image that merely resembles pixels is labeled
  `pixel_look_only`, not a production-valid sprite.
- **Flat or cel profiles:** discrete intended value bands, stable contour
  behavior, no unexplained gradients, and silhouette readability at target
  size.
- **Ink or print profiles:** stable mark vocabulary and surface treatment
  without false text, signatures, or random hatch noise.
- **Painterly profiles:** shared edge hierarchy, brush scale, value grouping,
  and focal-detail density rather than superficial texture alone.

Technical failure does not erase a valid style-recognition observation, but it
blocks a production-control verdict.

### Evidence and verdict vocabulary

| Field | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `evidence_status` | `untested` | Text inventory only; no model evidence |
| `evidence_status` | `exploratory` | Stop/go artifacts exist; no repeatability claim |
| `evidence_status` | `chain_reviewed` | Concept, extraction controls, and blind reviews are complete |
| `evidence_status` | `superseded` | Later model/version evidence replaces the recommendation |
| `recognition_verdict` | `not_observed` | No repeatable target signal |
| `recognition_verdict` | `weak_or_unstable` | Some target signal, but inconsistent |
| `recognition_verdict` | `concept_distinct` | Profile controls the concept, transfer not yet proven |
| `recognition_verdict` | `recognized_scoped` | Control survives only declared roles or contexts |
| `recognition_verdict` | `recognized_cross_role` | Control survives at least two applicable roles |
| `recognition_verdict` | `alias_collision` | Exact term is not separable from an alias or neighbor |
| `control_verdict` | `combined_control` | `RK` demonstrates useful reference-plus-descriptor control |
| `control_verdict` | `reference_dominant` | Reference explains continuity; keyword contribution is unproven |
| `control_verdict` | `descriptor_dominant` | Descriptor is portable; reference mainly supplies identity |
| `control_verdict` | `conditional` | Useful only with an observable-trait expansion or narrow scope |
| `control_verdict` | `entangled` | Content, demographic, era, layout, pose, or role explains the change |
| `control_verdict` | `diagnostic_only` | Stable model association is stereotyped or culturally unsound |
| `control_verdict` | `rejected` | Unusable, unsafe, rights-sensitive, or irrelevant |

Common failure codes are:

```text
anchor_evidence_missing
anchor_version_not_pinned
anchor_not_2d_relevant
ip_prompt_leak
taxonomy_axis_leak
keyword_not_observed
keyword_unstable
keyword_alias_collision

```

### Secondary atomic-keyword queue

The full inventory is a backlog, not authorization for bulk generation.
Profile-level tests answer the user's end-to-end question first. Atomic probes
then determine which words provide micro-variance and which merely ride along
inside a successful bundle.

Wave 1 is limited to these contrast clusters; every row is `untested`:

| Cluster | Atomic or established exact terms | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raster construction | `pixel art`, `limited palette`, `dithering` | Surface, color, mark construction |
| Line | `bold contour`, `clean line art`, `lineless` | Contour behavior |
| Shading | `hard cel shading`, `soft cel shading`, `painterly shading` | Value construction |
| Character grammar | `chibi`, `super-deformed`, `moe` | Proportion versus affect; `moe` is diagnostic |

`SD` is tested later as an exact ambiguous alias. Synthetic compounds such as
`2.5-head-tall chibi` are property expansions, not atomic-awareness tests.
Production roles such as `gacha card art`, `visual novel event CG`, or `anime
film background` never enter the atomic queue.

Run admitted atomic contrast clusters under the same wave rules. Freeze every
term and property expansion before the wave starts; do not add a term after
seeing another profile's output. A weak bare term may receive one separately
registered property-expansion record. A successful expansion proves descriptor
control, not awareness of the bare term.

### Evidence record

Every tested chain eventually records:

The exact original prompt may appear in this document. Provider responses,
temporary paths, credentials, signed URLs, and private references must not be
copied here. If the provider exposes no seed, record
`seed_status: unavailable`; never invent one.

### Exploratory run 001: built-in constrained-pixel smoke

This was one `CT` stop/go artifact, not a confirmation run, blinded comparison,
or promotion candidate. The temporary application path is intentionally omitted;
the artifact digest is its stable identifier. Two independent reviewers agreed
on the content and style verdicts.

Exact prompt:

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: exploratory 2D game concept scene for a style-control study; the scene itself must be final pixel artwork, not a painted concept sheet.
Primary request: Create one original game scene in even diffuse daylight. Show one clearly adult field cartographer beside a small freestanding weather station. The cartographer wears a teal coat and tan satchel. A round brass compass with one triangular blue enamel mark rests on a plain worktable. Behind them are a low stone shelter, three rounded hills, and one single narrow tree. Keep every named element visible, spatially separate, and easy to identify.
Style/medium, preserve exactly: low-resolution pixel art; limited sixteen-color total palette; one-pixel dark contours; clustered two-step shading; no gradients or antialiasing.
Composition/framing: landscape 16:9 wide scene; one character only; readable full silhouette; no close crop.
Lighting/mood: neutral even diffuse daylight; lighting must not introduce smooth gradients.
Technical pixel contract: visually author the scene on a nominal 320 x 180 pixel grid and show it only with integer nearest-neighbor enlargement; stable square pixel cells; coherent hand-placed pixel clusters; no interpolation, smoothing, subpixel strokes, blur, glow, film grain, or soft transparency.
Constraints: original and brand-neutral content only; no words, letters, numbers, UI, captions, logos, signatures, watermarks, borders, existing characters, or recognizable franchise elements.
Avoid: painterly concept art, vector-smooth edges, 3D rendering, fake high-resolution mosaic texture, mixed pixel sizes, excessive dithering.

### Reviewed run 002: OpenRouter concept-to-asset control chain

This run exercised all generation and review phases with original,
brand-neutral content.
It is a profile-control study, not yet an admitted game-anchor record: candidate
research anchor `a04` motivated the profile, but the exact release, platform,
and asset family were not pinned before generation. That lineage omission
cannot be repaired retroactively and blocks promotion of the keyword as
game-derived vocabulary. The visual evidence below remains useful for the
narrower provider-route question.

The request used OpenRouter's documented
[image-generation endpoint](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/multimodal/image-generation).
Authenticated endpoint inspection immediately before the run returned the exact
endpoint ID `openai/gpt-image-2`, consistent with OpenRouter's
[model page](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-image-2). The buffered generation
responses did not independently echo a model ID, so the evidence records the
requested model and authenticated endpoint separately from
`response_reported_model: unavailable`. The documented
[Batch API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/batch-quickstart) targets chat-completion
jobs; distinct image prompts therefore ran as bounded independent synchronous
requests rather than as one asynchronous provider batch.

#### Batch and validation ledger

Every successful response passed strict base64 decoding, PNG-signature checking,
non-empty media validation, caller validation, and an artifact-digest check.
The three retries below were transport/provider attempts owned by the component,
not semantic regenerations or nested runner retries.

| Wave | Purpose | Successful calls | Provider attempts | Cost (USD) | Result |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `001` | Five-profile exploratory concepts; `C0`, `CT`, `CN` | 15 | 15 | 1.960895 | One profile advanced |
| `002` | Four fresh confirmations for each inked-atmospheric concept arm | 12 | 12 | 1.567080 | `concept_distinct` |
| `003` | One exploratory extraction for four arms and three roles | 12 | 12 | 2.250637 | Character stayed exploratory; prop and background advanced |

#### Phase A result

In the first screen, each of three independent reviewers correctly recovered
the target, nearest-contrast, and neutral arms on all five randomized
three-image sheets. That proves visible separation in this sample, not
production suitability or repeatability.

| Profile | Observed target signal | Gate and decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `constrained_low_resolution_pixel_v1` | Coarse pixel-like treatment was recognizable | More than 100,000 RGB colors, no stable logical grid, gradients, and antialiasing: `pixel_look_only`; stop |
| `flat_bold_cartoon_v1` | Heavy contour, flat saturated fills, and compact geometry were clear | A strict content review found the required blue compass mark missing; stop |
| `inked_atmospheric_2d_v1` | Smooth ink-like contour, pale focal values, restrained color, soft modeling, and atmospheric depth were clear | Content and safety passed; advance |
| `luminous_highres_pixel_v1` | Dense pixel-like surface and decisive silhouettes were recognizable | Pixel construction was technically invalid and the emissive signal was weak; stop |
| `modern_dense_pixel_v1` | Dense pixel-like clusters and saturated local color were recognizable | No stable pixel grid, plus one strict review found only two clearly dominant hills; stop |

The confirmation wave then generated four fresh `C0`, `CT`, and `CN` outputs.
Each of the three blinded reviewers classified all 12 correctly. All four `CT`
outputs showed the five registered target traits and passed the content and
safety screen. The first qualifying `CT` by generation order, not aesthetic
preference, became the source concept:

phase_a_recognition_verdict: concept_distinct
```

#### Phase B result

All reviewers saw the selected source concept and randomized focused assets,
without prompts, keywords, or arm labels. The character screen remained
exploratory at one sample per arm. Two reviewers ranked `RK` above `R0`; one
ranked `R0` above `RK`; all placed those reference-bearing target treatments
above `RN` and `0K`. This is an initial reference-dominance signal, not a
confirmed character claim.

Prop and background each reached three samples per arm and three independent
reviews:

| Role | Unblinded result | Content result | Control interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prop | `RK` labels `A/E/I` and `R0` labels `D/H/K` formed one effectively tied source-like band. `RN` labels `B/G/J` were visibly heavier, flatter, and brighter. | All `RK` and `R0` outputs retained the simple blue-mark identity. Every `0K` output introduced a large compass rose; one `RN` output did too. | Repeatable continuity, but `RK ~= R0`; reference-dominant. Mismatched descriptors still steer. |
| Background | All six `RK` and `R0` outputs formed one source-like band; reviewers' finer visual clusters crossed arm boundaries. `RN` was consistently brighter, crisper, and more saturated, although the reference moderated the flat-bold request. | `RK`, `R0`, and `RN` retained the landmarks. `0K` retained the semantic element set but materially changed the shelter, hill, scale, or location identity. | Repeatable continuity, but `RK ~= R0`; very strong reference-dominance signal. |

The keyword-only `0K` arms carried a broadly compatible inked/atmospheric
treatment into both confirmed roles, but lost defining identity. The mismatched
`RN` arms shifted both roles toward the flat-bold contrast even while using the
same reference. Together with Phase A, that is enough for bundle-level
`recognized_cross_role`; it does not establish awareness of each atomic word.
The intended combined-control claim fails because adding the same descriptors
to the reference did not measurably outperform reference-only extraction.

review_summary: The route recognizes and can steer the exact descriptor bundle, and the concept can yield visually consistent focused assets. In this chain, the reference—not repetition of the same keyword bundle—explains the continuity.
```

Extraction prompt digests are stable across replications. `RK` and `0K` share
prompt text and differ only by whether the exact concept reference is attached.

## Promotion checklist

Before a result appears as a reviewed showcase:

- [ ] Raw candidates were cleaned so only the selected evidence remains.
- [ ] The exact provider/model/date and non-secret parameters are recorded.
- [ ] The exact original prompt and its digest are recorded.
- [ ] Artifact bytes and SHA-256 digests are stable.
- [ ] An independent reviewer evaluated the exact artifact against the
      pre-registered traits and nearest contrasts.
- [ ] The result is labeled accurately: one sample is never called repeatable.
- [ ] No artist, studio, franchise, product, character, signature, logo, or
      recognizable protected expression leaked into the output.
- [ ] Inputs and references, if any, have an explicit rights basis.
- [ ] The manifest and exact-image review report agree.
- [ ] Documentation and repository media gates pass.

## Research notes and sources

- The [Kyoto International Manga Museum's Manga Wall](https://kyotomm.jp/en/manga-wall/)
  organizes shonen, shojo, and seinen as readership/publishing groupings. That
  supports treating them as dialect candidates rather than fixed renderers.
- Scholarship on the [formation of shojo manga](https://academic.oup.com/hawaii-scholarship-online/book/17611/chapter-abstract/175248026)
  and the [origin of a distinctive shojo manga style](https://academic.oup.com/minnesota-scholarship-online/book/21222/chapter-abstract/180875093)
  shows that publishing history and visual conventions interact; neither can be
  reduced to a timeless single look.
- Animation scholarship warns that
  [anime is not homogeneous](https://journal.animationstudies.org/article/id/39/)
  and discusses chibi-like distortion, enlarged eyes, and simplified features as
  variable visual devices.
- A computer-graphics study defines
  [super-deformed or SD characters](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1360302870460667392)
  through exaggerated proportions such as oversized heads and short limbs. This
  makes `super-deformed` a stronger measurable candidate than geography alone.
- Research on [moe and fantasy](https://mail.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/2009/Galbraith.html)
  describes `moe` as a response to fantasy characters rather than one specific
  style. The label remains testable as model vocabulary, but it must be
  decomposed before canonical use.
- A [Korean Culture and Information Service overview](https://www.korean-culture.org/eng/webzine/202404/sub01.html)
  describes webtoons around online serialization and the development of
  vertical scrolling, supporting the decision to keep format separate from
  rendering style.
- The Metropolitan Museum of Art distinguishes
  [ukiyo-e](https://www.metmuseum.org/ja/essays/art-of-the-pleasure-quarters-and-the-ukiyo-e-style),
  [yamato-e](https://www.metmuseum.org/fr/essays/yamato-e-painting), and the
  [Rinpa aesthetic](https://www.metmuseum.org/ja/perspectives/japan-rinpa-school-screens)
  as historically situated lineages with different media, motifs, and formal
  conventions.
- The Met's guide to
  [Chinese painting](https://www.metmuseum.org/zh/essays/chinese-painting) and
  [baimiao line drawing](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2008/anatomy-of-a-masterpiece/photo-gallery)
  supports separating brush line, ink wash, shading, and subject tradition.
- MoMA's descriptions of
  [screenprint](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/screenprint)
  and [lithography](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/lithography) illustrate
  why process terms should predict observable surface traits rather than serve
  as vague aesthetic labels.

## Decision log

- The canonical home is `concept-studio/style-dictionary/`, a tracked
  pre-production research directory, not a component or packaged skill.
- The first phase established the text taxonomy before any model evidence; only
  explicitly recorded profiles leave `untested`.
- The public artifact is one guide document. Machine-readable registries may be
  added only if the reviewed evidence becomes too large for this page.
- Broad regional words are negative controls, not accepted style names.
- `moe` remains a candidate but is not defined as a single visual style.
- `SD` is tested as an exact alias, while `super_deformed` is the preferred
  canonical ID.
- Production roles include actors, cutscenes, environments, props, cards, UI,
  and effects and remain separate from style.
- Photorealism is not prioritized for the first 2D-game study.
- The first OpenRouter route visibly separated all five exploratory descriptor
  profiles, but style recognition and production-valid asset construction are
  different gates; all three pixel profiles stopped before extraction.
- `inked_atmospheric_2d_v1` is recognized across prop and background roles, but
  `RK ~= R0`; the concept reference explains continuity better than repetition
  of the same descriptor bundle.
- The global game catalog is the upstream source for future keyword admission.
  Run 002 predates its pinned asset-family gate and therefore remains profile
  evidence rather than an admitted game-derived keyword record.
- No generated image is promoted or committed without independent review and
  the repository's media-rights gates.
