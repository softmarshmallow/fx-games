"""Check or rewrite the graph-contract blocks in each workflow's contract.md.

Each block is the shape of a workflow's offline sample plan, ``CODE.sample_plan`` in its
``workflow.py``: topology digest, node count, operation counts, outputs and the type ids it
places. A phase whose size is a result of an earlier one (universe's gallery) is priced when
its list exists, so the block holds the phases the plan can count. Game graph contracts have
their own writer under
``godot/tools``; shared block formatting belongs to ``scripts.graph_contracts``.

Every block is built twice, each time in a fresh scratch folder, and a block whose two builds
differ is refused, so a block holds only what any machine plans the same way.
