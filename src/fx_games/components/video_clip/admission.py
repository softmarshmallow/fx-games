"""Objective admission for a generated clip.

Five facts a decoder can state about a clip, each refusing rather than
repairing. Four are shape - one video stream, the expected codec, the picture
size the layout declared, and a length within a frame of what was asked for.
The fifth is the one that matters and the one no still ever needed: **does it
move**. A video route answering a clip brief with a beautiful still is the
failure this component exists to catch, and it is invisible to every other
check in the tree.

Whether the clip is *good* is a person's call and a reviewer's, never inferred
here. So is whether any lettering crept into a frame: no gate can read a frame
for text, and one that pretended to would be worse than none.

Every constant carries the measurement that set it. They were taken on the
shell spike's own clips - fifteen generated files and a synthesized still - and
re-taken after the Theora transcode, because the picture a player sees is the
published one and the gates run on both.

#: Mean sample-to-sample difference, 0-255. Measured: a still encoded as video
#: reads 0.0004 as h264 and 0.0011 through Theora; the quietest clip anyone
#: actually wanted - "the smallest motion that still reads as alive" - reads
#: 0.4405; a cut trailer reads 5.8. This floor sits 45x above the still and
#: 8.8x below the quiet clip. A "sensible" 1.0 would have refused the good one.
CLIP_MOTION_FLOOR_MEAN = 0.05

#: Mean luma over the clip, and a band at least one sample must sit inside.
#: Measured: a multi-beat clip dips to YAVG 1.5 at a fade and peaks at 226.6 at
#: a flare, so a per-frame band would refuse a fade. Judging the mean, plus
#: requiring one frame that is neither black nor blown out, refuses an empty
#: return without refusing a clip that opens or closes on darkness.
