"""Objective admission for a spoken-line draw.

Two facts a decoder can state about the bytes, each refusing rather than
repairing: the level gates the sound-effect route already proved (a dead draw
and a clipped draw are both refused, never normalized), and the one gate a
speech route needs that a sound route does not - a length ceiling. The route
has no duration control, so the cue states the longest read its frame budget
tolerates and a longer draw is refused inside the retry owner and redrawn.
Trimming it would be post-processing, which is forbidden repository-wide.

Whether the line *sounds like* the character is a person's call and is
recorded as ``listening_verdict``, never inferred.
