"""The authored, provider-neutral shape of one spoken line.

A cue that asks for a spoken line - a *bark* in the industry's word: a short,
event-triggered one-liner - states the text the voice reads verbatim, delivery
annotations included, the game-owned voice that reads it, how literally the
voice follows the text, and the longest read the cue's frame budget tolerates.
That is the whole request: the recipe compiles nothing onto the text, and the
author should read the model boundary in ``docs/spec/model-eleven-v3.md``
before writing it.

The voice is named, never identified: ``voice_id`` is resolved through the
game's voice catalog (``voices.toml``), because a provider's voice reference is
an externally-held identity with its own rights and does not belong in a genre
audio contract any more than a model id does.

Playback mixing - gain and the strength-driven rate lift - is consumer data. It
travels with the line in the manifest but stays out of the generation identity,
so rebalancing after listening never re-bills a read.

A read is a lottery and a person picks the winner, so a line carries the same
two fields a generated clip does: ``take``, the reroll ordinal that re-keys
this one read, and ``pinned``, the reviewed audition committed into the
package and republished in place of a fresh draw.
