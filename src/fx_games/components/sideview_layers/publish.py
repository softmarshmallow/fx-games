"""A painted layer's gate and its publication: the pure halves every layer step shares.

A painting is admitted at the provider canvas against the host's floors; an admitted loop
unit is trimmed to its alpha box, its placement resolved from the raster it actually got,
and re-admitted as a repeat; a reviewer reads three repeats side by side. The steps that
call these live with the games (``demo_game_tools.steps.layers``).
