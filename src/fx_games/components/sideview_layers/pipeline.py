"""The horizontal-loop layer pipeline shared by side-view genres.

Admission-first loop handling for one generated parallax layer: which
provider canvas each generative construction shows, how its return is landed,
which constructions need no provider at all, and the admission policies a
layer's alpha mode implies. Lifted out of the platformer's world handler when
the runner became the second consumer; the per-genre handlers own their node
wiring and fallbacks, while the constructions themselves live here and in
`fx_games.media`.
