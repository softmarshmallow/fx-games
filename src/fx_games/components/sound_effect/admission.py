"""Objective admission for a generated sound-effect draw.

These are the only automated verdicts the evidence supports. Each is a fact a
decoder can state about the bytes, and each refuses rather than repairs: the
asset is whatever the provider returned, and a bad draw is redrawn inside the
retry owner, never normalized or trimmed. Whether a clip *sounds like* its cue
is a person's call and is recorded as ``listening_verdict``, never inferred.
