"""The authored, provider-neutral shape of one generated sound-effect clip.

A cue that asks for a generated clip states the prompt the provider receives
verbatim, the exact duration to fill, and how literally to follow the text.
That is the whole request: the recipe compiles nothing onto the prompt, so the
author owns what the model hears and should read the model boundary in
``docs/spec/model-eleven-text-to-sound-v2.md`` before writing it.

Playback mixing - gain and the strength-driven rate lift - is consumer data.
It travels with the clip in the manifest but stays out of the generation
identity, so rebalancing a set after listening never re-bills a draw. No
provider or model identifier belongs here.

Two fields exist because a draw is a lottery and a person picks the winner.
``take`` is the reroll ordinal: it enters the identity and nothing else, so
bumping it redraws this one effect and leaves every other node a cache hit.
``pinned`` is the pick: a reviewed audition committed into the package by
digest, with the sidecar that produced it and a rights statement, republished
through the same admission with no provider call - the way a digest-locked
reference pins a reviewed image.
