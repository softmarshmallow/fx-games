"""Deterministic vertical reference frames for horizontally looping layer rasters.

A placement contract has to name *which* line it registers. Four frames are measurable on one
raster, and they are not interchangeable:

``source box``
    The full raster. This is the frame the layer was painted in, so it stays the scale datum
    even after empty rows are trimmed away.
``alpha box``
    Axis-aligned bounds of ``alpha >= alpha_threshold``. The conventional trim box.
``coverage line``
    The extreme scanline that *every* column still spans. Registering a ragged bottom edge by
    its deepest tip leaves the gaps between tips uncovered; registering by this line does not.
``opaque band``
    The same "every column" question asked at an opacity threshold rather than a meaningful-alpha
    threshold.

The last two are one family: ``any column`` gives the alpha box, ``all columns`` gives a coverage
line, and the threshold picks which of the two lines you get. Generated PNGs do not reliably reach
``alpha == 255``, so the opaque threshold is a declared part of the contract rather than a literal
opacity test.

Horizontal extent is deliberately never trimmed. A looping layer's width is its repeat period,
owned by the map's ``continuity.seamless_axis``, and cropping it would break the loop.
