"""What a workflow is, read from its folder: a code hook and a small manifest.

Each product workflow is one folder under ``stage_gen/workflows/`` whose name is its id with
``-`` written as ``_``. Facts the code knows live in code: ``workflow.py`` exports ``CODE``,
a ``WorkflowCode`` whose steps reference the real ``NodeType`` objects, and whose identity,
offline sample plan and run ownership are read from the implementation. Facts the code cannot
know - title, promise, related workflows, tools, output notes and pinned examples - live in
``workflow.toml``, which is read without importing the workflow, so listing workflows stays
cheap. Prose sits beside them in ``page.mdx`` and ``contract.md``.

The catalog is built from these manifests, so this module imports neither the engine nor any
media library when it loads; they are imported where they are used.
