# Universe source examples

`lantern_ferry/` is a source-checkout fixture with original procedural reference
art, synopsis, and expansion direction. Its input directory is excluded from
Python distributions as one unit, so installed packages never carry a partial
runnable example with missing image references.

To author another universe, supply your own local directory containing an
`inputs.yaml`, the poster it names, and the synopsis and expansion direction
documents. `uv run python -m grida.fx schema universe` prints the inputs, and the
universe source contract in `src/stage_gen/workflows/universe/contract.md` says
what each one is for. The repository fixture's image can be regenerated with
`scripts/author_universe_fixture_poster.py`; that script writes the checkout
fixture, not an installed-package resource.
