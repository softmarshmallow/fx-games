"""The viewer, the dashboard ``gnode view`` starts: a local read-only client over run folders.

Stage Gen installs it as a gnode plugin of its own (``viewer`` in ``gnode.plugins``), apart
from the one that composes its routes and providers, because it reads the workflow catalog.

The viewer is the Next app in ``web/viewer``, so it needs a source checkout and Bun; from an
installed wheel it refuses. gnode keeps the run views fresh in its cache; this exports the
catalog the viewer groups runs by into the user cache and starts the viewer's dev server
with the run roots, the catalog and the view cache in its environment, provider keys left
out. Nothing it starts can start a run: the viewer only reads. However it ends, by the
server exiting, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or a hangup, it first ends the server and every process the
server started.
