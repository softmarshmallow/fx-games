"""Deterministic composition of one comparison plate from artifacts that have already shipped.

A plate answers a question a bounding box cannot: is this the same subject, drawn at the same
scale, as the one beside it? Alpha extent conflates pose with draw scale - a crouch is shorter
because of the pose and a mis-scaled sheet is shorter because of the artwork - so the reading is
taken by a vision model, and this module's job is to give that model an image where the answer is
visible.

Two properties make that possible, and both are structural rather than cosmetic:

* **One uniform source scale across every frame.** Nothing is normalised, fit, or padded to a
  common height. A group the model drew small must look small, because that difference is the
  entire signal. Refitting each group to a common height would erase the thing being measured.
* **A shared ground line per group, and the baseline's crown drawn across all of them.** A ratio
  is only readable against a reference the model can see in the same image.

The plate is not a fiducial. A reference composited into a *generation* is redrawn by the provider
and carries no ground truth; a plate assembled locally from bytes that have already shipped is
exact, costs no provider operation, and cannot be redrawn.

This module is provider-neutral and knows nothing about actors, states, or games. Callers supply
labelled groups of frames; the recipe that owns the vocabulary decides what a group means.
