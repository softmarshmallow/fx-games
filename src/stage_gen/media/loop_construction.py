"""Deterministic constructions that make a raster loop on its horizontal axis.

Four constructions are supported. They differ on two axes, and both matter to callers.

**Agent** — whether the construction needs a provider operation at all. ``mirror_repeat`` is purely
local; the other three each cost exactly one image edit. The execution graph reads this to decide
whether the loop node is external, so it is a structural property rather than a documentation note.

**Guarantee** — where the loop's continuity actually comes from. This predicts which constructions
survive a hard input, and it is not the same thing as output quality:

``reflection``
    The wrap join is a mirror, continuous by geometry, and cannot fail.
    ``mirror_repeat`` and ``fold_repaint``.

``interior``
    The wrap is relocated into the *interior* of the canvas the provider sees, so continuity across
    it is something the model paints through rather than something we impose on it afterwards.
    ``seam_repaint``.

``anchored``
    The wrap joins sit at the provider canvas *boundary* and are forced equal afterwards by
    :func:`_anchor_columns`. ``generated_bridge``. This is the weakest tier and the reason is worth
    stating plainly: anchoring assigns the very join that a downstream metric then measures, so a
    bridged join always scores perfectly whether or not the art actually meets.

Source mutability is per-construction, not global. ``mirror_repeat`` and ``generated_bridge`` only
ever append, so the original stays recoverable from the result. ``seam_repaint`` and
``fold_repaint`` replace pixels around the join, so it does not. Every record carries
``mutates_source`` so no consumer has to infer it from a construction name.
