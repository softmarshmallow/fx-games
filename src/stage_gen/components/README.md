# Components

A component is an independently testable package under `src/stage_gen/components/`: node
types, graph fragments (`add_*_nodes`), contracts and services. It never runs alone and never
imports a workflow. Workflows compose components in their node types; gnode plans, runs,
caches and inspects those compositions. A component can expose several GNode nodes,
and it does not need a game package or a particular runtime.

## Components

| Component | Public surface | Output or responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Repeating images | `image_repeat.validate_image_repeat`, `image_repeat.build_three_repeat_preview` | Deterministic single-axis seam validation and the three-repeat preview |
| Layered scenery | `sideview_layers.models.LayerRequest`, `sideview_layers.publish` | Repeat construction, the painted layer's gate, trimming and placement |
| Supplied-layer parallax | `sideview_layers.parallax`, `workflows.looping_parallax` | Repeating PNGs, portable composition metadata, and a scrolling preview |
| Fixed portrait motion | `portrait_motion` | Local eye/mouth patches, registration, review, and diagnostic playback |
| Rigged characters | `character_3d` | Profiles, partitions, quality bars, studios and the Blender worker |
| Sound effects | `sound_effect.SoundEffectRequest` | One effect asset or pinned take; gameplay response is separate |
| Speech | `speech.SpeechRequest` | One line and admission budget with a caller-owned voice binding |
| Video inspection | `video_clip` | Caller-specified size, codec, duration, and optional aspect constraints |

The kits only the games use (actors, terrain, UI, effects, screens, music, voices, world
generation, map design, character profiles) live in
[`demo_game_tools.kits`](../../../godot/games/_shared/python/src/demo_game_tools/kits/README.md),
beside the games that own them; the asset product never imports them.

Existing fixed geometry remains useful as named presets. The local eye/mouth portrait pipeline does not claim to represent every Live2D workflow. Authors can compose different components or add their own nodes through the same SDK.

Runnable inputs live beside workflows. Start with [`../workflows/looping_parallax/inputs/supplied_layers/`](../workflows/looping_parallax/inputs/supplied_layers/): its small Python input generator produces original geometric layers without a provider, and its `pipeline.py` runs through the SDK. Inspecting or scrolling the result requires no game definition.

## Contract

A Stage Gen component is an independently testable application package under
`src/stage_gen/components/`, such as sprite-sheet processing, soundtrack assembly,
or an authored game contract. Components call no provider themselves: image generation,
background removal, structured generation and music generation are calls a node type makes
through Grida FX, which owns their specifications, retries and provider adapters.

Shared, workflow-neutral media inspection and transforms live under
`src/stage_gen/media/`; component-specific processing stays with its component,
and workflow-specific canonicalization stays with its workflow. A workflow composes
components into a graph; a runtime or preview consumes its artifacts.

### Required properties

Artifact-producing components must:

1. accept typed or schema-validated input;
2. write only below the caller-provided output directory;
3. return an artifact manifest rather than relying on implicit filenames;
4. validate media before reporting success;
5. use one retry owner per provider operation, with at most six attempts
   (one initial attempt plus five retries) and capped backoff;
6. include silent contract failures such as empty media or malformed JSON
   within that same retry boundary;
7. persist provenance and a content hash beside the artifact;
8. make deterministic post-processing explicit and independently testable;
9. support cancellation/timeouts without leaving a success marker; and
10. expose enough information for a headless benchmark.

When a component uses a gnode modality service, that service owns provider retries;
the component and provider adapter must not add nested retry loops.

### Structure

The properties above say what a component does; this says what one looks like, so
that a reader who has seen one has seen them all. A component is a package under
`src/stage_gen/components/` whose `__init__.py` exports its surface in `__all__`,
holding:

- `models.py` — the authored contract: the pydantic models and the vocabulary they
  close over, with their persisted `kind` and version literals;
- `loader.py` and `library.py` where the component reads authored files or resolves a
  library binding;
- one or more node-family modules, `nodes.py` or `<family>_nodes.py`, each holding a
  family's `NodeType` declarations (with `<family>_node_types(identity_prefix=…)` when
  a graph shipped the family under its own type ids), an `add_<family>_nodes` graph
  helper that declares the nodes and their ports over a builder, and a
  `<Family>Handlers` kit over a `<Family>Host` that a workflow or game graph binds into its own node
  handler - the soundtrack, motion-rebase, layer, UI atlas and inventory-panel
  families are the shape;
- private helpers as `_<name>.py`, shared across components through
  `components/_node_kit.py` and its siblings rather than copied.

A component imports the engine, `stage_gen.media`, `stage_gen.canonical` and other
components; never a workflow, a game, the orchestration layer or a provider. Workflows and
game graphs host node families; they do not own node semantics. No graph-helper departure
stands today: `GRAPH_HELPER_DEPARTURES` in `tests/contract/test_component_structure.py` is
empty, and any new one must be named there. A game built with gnode instead hosts a family
as gnode step types (`demo_game_tools.steps`), over the pure parts of its kit: the effects
kit is only those (`effects_art/directions.py`, `cut_in.py`, `sprite.py`).

### Independence rule

The reusable contract does not assume a genre, camera, engine, coordinate
system, movement model, combat model, or gameplay loop. Those may be explicit
inputs to a specialized workflow, but they are never ambient global state.

For example, a sprite-sheet component may accept `{ rows, columns, anchors }`.
It must not silently assume that row 2 is a jump animation. A depth-layer
component may accept a requested projection and loop axis. It must not assume a
horizontal follow camera because one preview happens to use one.

The provider-neutral recovery, crop, and packing boundary is specified by the
[sprite-sheet slicing and instance-recovery contract](../../../docs/spec/sprite-sheet-processing.md).
The Python core implements its minimal alpha-component repacker; generic grid detection and
semantic ownership recovery remain planned. The contract does not reserve workflow or consumer
behavior inside reusable components.

Components must not import `web/`. The viewer and the site consume exported manifests and
examples; they never reach into a component.

## Failure contract

Failures distinguish provider/transport errors, response-contract failures,
input validation errors, and deterministic post-processing failures. Error
messages may name environment variables but must never include credential
values or full authorization headers.

Partial outputs may remain for debugging only when clearly marked incomplete.
They must not satisfy skip-if-exists or cache checks.
