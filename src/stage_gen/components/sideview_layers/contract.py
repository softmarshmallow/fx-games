#: Anchors whose offset the producer measures rather than trusting an authored guess. They do not
#: share a registration rule: `screen_bottom` seals the frame edge and needs a row every column
#: spans, while `walk_surface` meets the ground and registers on the row the content rests on,
#: because a midground layer is legitimately sparse between its subjects.
BOTTOM_REGISTERED_ANCHORS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"screen_bottom", "walk_surface"})

#: The top edge is measured by the mirror of the bottom seal. A canopy hung from the screen top
#: has a ragged upper edge too - vine tips reach above the bar they hang from - and registering
#: the alpha box puts that sparse fringe against the edge with sky showing through it. The seal is
#: the first row every column spans, lifted above the edge. A layer with no such row is a fringe
#: rather than a ceiling and keeps its alpha-box registration: sky through hanging vines is the
#: picture, not a gap.
TOP_REGISTERED_ANCHORS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"screen_top"})

#: Fields that describe where or how a generated layer is consumed rather than what the image
#: model should paint. They are excluded from generation cache identity so adjusting placement or
#: runtime depth treatment never re-bills an image.
NON_GENERATIVE_LAYER_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {"vertical_anchor", "vertical_offset", "display_scale", "presentation", "loop_construction"}

#: Presentation and display scale do not alter local canonicalization or repeat admission either.
#: They are projected only into the prepared runtime manifest and applied by the consumer; a host
#: whose review board mirrors the consumer binds display scale into that board's identity itself.
RUNTIME_ONLY_LAYER_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"presentation", "display_scale"})

#: The ground equivalent: authored geometry and vertical fit select cells and placement
#: downstream without changing the appearance request sent to the provider.
#: Ground fields that place the atlas without changing what is painted. Geometry used to live
#: here too; it is now a generated artifact the map does not carry, so the material atlas cannot
#: depend on terrain shape even by accident.
PLACEMENT_ONLY_GROUND_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"vertical_fit"})

#: Climbable placement moved out of the authored document entirely, so the atlas image can no
#: longer see it. Nothing needs excluding; the roster the map declares is all that reaches the
#: image call.
PLACEMENT_ONLY_CLIMBABLE_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset()

#: Geometry for the repaint constructions. The window is the whole canvas the provider sees,
#: centred on the join it is repairing; the span is the editable middle of that window. The window
#: is deliberately wider than the bridge's total canvas: the repaint constructions spend their

#: inventing a span.

#: honour a mask, and registration correction shifts the span vertically, so an edited span always

#: `seam_repaint` cuts instead, because easing a span onto one fixed column smeared every village
#: repaint at both inner joins.
LOOP_ANCHOR_BAND_PX = 24
#: Where `seam_repaint` may cut its return into the source. Each cut is searched from
#: LOOP_REPAINT_CUT_REACH_PX columns into the context to LOOP_REPAINT_CUT_GUARD_PX columns short of

#: Identity of the brief the provider is given for a bridge. It is versioned separately from the

#: a strip, the bridge brief joins one. Sending the composing brief here is what makes the model
#: invent landmarks across the cut.
LOOP_BRIDGE_BRIEF_VERSION = "loop-bridge-brief-v2"
#: Identity of the brief for the repaint constructions. Separate from the bridge brief because the
#: request is materially different: a repaint asks for continuity through a region the provider can
#: already see both sides of, where a bridge asks it to invent one between two ends it cannot.
LOOP_REPAINT_BRIEF_VERSION = "loop-repaint-brief-v1"

#: How a generative loop brief frames the request. `join` is what ships today. `restoration` asks
#: the provider to restore a region described as mistakenly removed, which replicated better at
#: n=7 (median residual 12.73 -> 8.17, join step 1.0 -> 0.0, drift outliers eliminated). Both are
#: carried so the framing is a bound, reviewable choice rather than an untracked prompt edit;
#: selecting `restoration` is a separate decision from promoting the constructions themselves.
