// Server-side reader for a run's execution view: the one the run persists, or the one
// `scripts/view.py` derived for it into the user cache.
//
// The run folder's own view is read when it is at least as new as the cached one;
// otherwise the cache's, which `scripts/view.py` keeps fresh while the run's trace grows.
// A run is never written to: a view the viewer needs and the run lacks lives only in the
// cache. Absent is null; present-but-refused throws — the page turns that into the
// re-derive message rather than a crash, per the view's hard-drop versioning.
