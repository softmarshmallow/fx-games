# Stage Gen

Stage Gen is a general asset generation toolkit. Each workflow turns a small input into a
named deliverable, such as a transparent idle loop, a rigged 3D character or a set of
repeating parallax layers, and every workflow is a GNode graph you can run and inspect. All
but 3D character plan offline before any spend, and most reuse a node cache across runs.
Inspect runs in the viewer, the local read-only client that `uv run python scripts/view.py` opens. Your
application decides how the assets become a game, an animation or a tool.

## Workflows

Each workflow is one folder under `src/stage_gen/workflows/` with its declaration, page,
contract and examples. This table is checked against each folder's `workflow.toml`.

<!-- workflows:begin -->
| Workflow | Id | Promise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [3D character](src/stage_gen/workflows/character_3d/page.mdx) | `character-3d` | One written brief in. One rigged, reviewed character out. |
| [Looping parallax](src/stage_gen/workflows/looping_parallax/page.mdx) | `looping-parallax` | Layer pictures in. Repeating layers and their scroll placement out. |
| [Movie sprite](src/stage_gen/workflows/movie_sprite/page.mdx) | `movie-sprite` | One character picture in. A transparent idle loop out. |
| [Portrait motion](src/stage_gen/workflows/portrait_motion/page.mdx) | `portrait-motion` | One finished sprite in. Eyes and mouth a game can drive separately out. |
| [Universe](src/stage_gen/workflows/universe/page.mdx) | `universe` | A poster, a synopsis and a direction in. A reviewed storyworld and one concept image per entity out. |

The [3D character](src/stage_gen/workflows/character_3d/page.mdx) and
[movie sprite](src/stage_gen/workflows/movie_sprite/page.mdx) workflows made these; the
[preview notes](.github/assets/readme/README.md) say how.

## Install and try it

Python 3.12 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are required. gnode's successor,
[Grida FX](https://github.com/gridaco/fx), is a submodule at `third_party/fx`, which `uv sync`
installs from: clone with `--recurse-submodules`, or run `git submodule update --init` once. Its
engine is Rust: `python3 third_party/fx/tools/build_engine.py` builds it (cargo from
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)) once anything here uses FX. From this checkout:

```sh
git submodule update --init
uv sync --frozen
uv run python -m grida.fx schema looping-parallax
uv run python src/stage_gen/workflows/looping_parallax/inputs/supplied_layers/make_inputs.py out/looping-parallax-input
uv run python -m grida.fx plan looping-parallax --inputs out/looping-parallax-input/inputs.yaml
uv run python -m grida.fx run looping-parallax --inputs out/looping-parallax-input/inputs.yaml
uv run python -m grida.fx inspect looping-parallax --verify
uv run python scripts/view.py
```

That run is offline: committed scripts draw the input layers, and no provider is called.
Every workflow is a gnode workflow file, so `gnode` plans, runs and inspects each by its id;
`gnode schema <id>` prints the inputs it takes, and its run folders are under `out/runs/`.
Planning never spends; a provider call needs `--live` and your own keys (see
[provider setup](docs/models/providers.md)). Your own workflow is a workflow file or a Python
builder, which `python -m grida.fx plan` and `run` take the same way; the
[FX guide](https://github.com/gridaco/fx/tree/main/docs/guide) shows how to write one.

## Godot example project

The repository also houses a separately owned consumer product, the
[Godot example project](godot/README.md): its [example games](godot/games/README.md),
runtime packages, templates and tools show ways to use Stage Gen assets, under its own
[charter](godot/CHARTER.md). Games own their scenes, controls, narrative and asset wiring;
Stage Gen requires no game or gameplay contract.
