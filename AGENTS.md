# AGENTS.md

Repository-specific guardrails. [README.md](README.md) owns setup, [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) boundaries,
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) contribution policy, and [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) gates. Focused procedures
live in [providers](docs/models/providers.md), [publication](docs/generated-media-publication.md), [storage](docs/repository-storage.md),
and [IP](docs/oss-ip.md). This file controls applicability; focused docs control procedure and must be reconciled on conflict.

## Architecture

- Keep identifiers, comments, logs, tests, and user-facing source strings in English.
- This repository has two separately owned products: the main Stage Gen asset product and the maintained Godot
  example project. [The Godot charter](godot/CHARTER.md) owns the latter's purpose and internal evolution.
  Further runtime, shared game-system or visual-novel refactors belong within Godot; reuse by multiple games
  does not by itself justify moving them into the asset product.
- Python is the headless implementation. Stage Gen's asset product has two layers: Grida FX (`third_party/fx`) is the
  engine and `src/stage_gen/` is the application that consumes it. gnode's rings (`docs/spec/gnode-rings.md`):
  ring 0 the agnostic engine core (topology, scheduling, trace, run view, model bindings, reliability,
  provenance — media-free), ring 1 per-modality model specs and retry-owning services, ring 2 first-party
  provider adapters. A ring imports only rings below it; nothing game-, workflow-, or genre-specific belongs
  in any ring, and the engine ships no brand — provenance identities come from the application. Consumers
  import only declared surfaces (`from gnode import X`; provider adapters via `gnode.providers.<name>`);
  gnode imports no application package; a contract test enforces all of it. Providers
  implement the ring-1 protocols, and orchestration is the composition root. Shared workflow-neutral media
  inspection and transforms belong in `media`; capability-specific processing stays with its component, and
  workflow-specific canonicalization with its workflow.
- The product owns asset-pipeline authoring, execution, artifacts and inspection. Components own bounded capabilities;
  workflows compose useful asset outcomes. Their inputs never require a complete game, selected demo or gameplay schema.
  Consumer adapters own runtime camera, scene, engine and gameplay assumptions. `web/viewer` and `web/site` consume
  public run/artifact contracts and are not a second generator. Bounded animation, terrain and spatial asset contracts
  may remain optional. Scenario authoring and execution belong to the Godot package; they are not asset-product components.
- Scenario is the Godot-owned VN-oriented invocation framework. Games own and invoke their sequences,
  grant installed capabilities and retain simulation, input, objects, cameras and saves. Keep narrative
  direction in data and mechanism implementations in declared bindings; do not dispatch by story/beat ID.
  `game_presentation` remains a lower dependency and imports no Scenario or game code.
- Complete game builders, gameplay schemas and their existing inputs/readers belong to their Godot game under
  `godot/games/`. Each game owns its project, preparation and bindings. Private reuse by multiple games belongs
  under `godot/games/_shared/`; independently usable runtime packages belong under `godot/packages/`.
  Shared support and packages never import a named game. Preserve supported reader/input pairs
  without requiring a TOML rewrite. Game code may import the public asset product; the product never imports games.
- Each workflow owns its declaration, page, contract and examples. Changes to its stages,
  asset dependencies, consumed inputs, operation counts or cache/scheduling semantics update that evidence together.
  Whole-game graph specifications apply only to their owning game consumers, not every future asset pipeline.

## Grida FX submodule

- `third_party/fx` is [gridaco/fx](https://github.com/gridaco/fx), a separate public product, pinned as a
  submodule. Stage Gen uses it only through `grida.fx` imports and the `grida-fx` command (`python -m grida.fx`),
  as a path dependency on `third_party/fx/python`. Changes to FX follow its own `AGENTS.md` and gates, make sense
  without Stage Gen, are committed in the submodule, and reach gridaco/fx before Stage Gen's pointer moves
  (`push.recurseSubmodules=check` refuses a push that would pin an unpushed FX commit). Stage Gen's own linters
  skip `third_party/`.

## Skills

- `skills/<name>/` holds skills users install (`npx skills add`). Each stands alone in any folder: no path into this
  repository and no Stage Gen command. A skill that calls a provider itself does so through the public Grida FX
  command. `.agents/skills/`
  (`.claude/skills` links to it) holds only the skills for working on this repository.

## Schema naming

- Schema definitions and persisted/public contract fields use `lower_snake_case`; do not add camelCase aliases for
  convenience. Translate to language-native runtime shapes only at explicit adapters or boundaries. Preserve mandatory
  external-standard vocabulary exactly, including JSON Schema `$ref`, `$defs`, and `additionalProperties`.

## Provider and artifact safety

- Provider routes are declared in a `gnode` binding table as `model@provider` with the features each route supports;
  a missing feature is refused while planning, offline, before any spend. Do not name a model inside a node's logic.
- Each AI/provider operation has one retry owner and at most six attempts: one initial plus five retries with capped
  backoff. Keep transport, decoding, schema/media checks, and caller validation inside it; disable nested retry loops.
- Mark artifacts successful only after validation and rollback-safe atomic artifact-plus-sidecar persistence. Cache
  reuse must validate content and lineage, not merely path existence.
- Use the existing allowlisted provider-key loader. Treat `.env` as optional and local; never assume it is populated,
  overwrite, print, or commit it, or copy provider secrets into `web/` (the viewer, the site or their shared `ui`).
  `.env.example` owns non-secret defaults.
- Offline operation is the default. Live/provider calls require explicit task intent and documented opt-in. Re-check current provider contracts before changing adapters or model identifiers.
- Pipeline run artifacts require canonical portable provenance, because the manifest, cache, and consumers read it.
  A figure or capture authored for the docs is not a pipeline artifact and gets none. Never persist credentials,
  authorization headers, signed URLs, embedded references, private absolute or temporary paths. Confine writes and
  reject traversal or symlink escapes.

## Media and rights

- Use canonical fixtures in place. Copy only across a real package, build, deployment, or public-consumer ownership
  boundary; preserve provenance and rights, do not symlink across it, and never promote unreviewed output into fixtures.
- Prompts, examples, fixtures, and committed media must be original and brand-neutral. Referenced inputs need a
  documented rights basis; source licensing does not grant media redistribution.
- Accepted generated visuals require semantic review by someone other than their producer. Reference inspection and
  exploration do not; label exploration unreviewed. Audio quality claims need a separate listening verdict.
  Semantic regeneration runs are not provider retries.
- Generated media published as art is unapproved by default. Follow publication and storage gates before commit or
  publication; public binding, activation, or publication requires explicit authorization. The gate covers the declared
  publication roots only; `docs/media` and `docs/diagrams` are documentation and carry no sidecar or inventory entry.

## Verification

- Run focused checks for each changed boundary. For Python handoff run credential-free `uv run python scripts/check.py`;
  follow `VERIFICATION.md` for docs and web gates. Offline gates remain provider-free; live and semantic gates stay scoped.
