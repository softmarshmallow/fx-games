"""What a shell plate must prove from its pixels, and what is left to a reviewer.

Two families of picture live here and they fail differently.

A **backdrop** or a **shot still** is a full-bleed picture. Almost nothing about it is
decidable — whether the valley reads as cold, whether the composition is any good, is a
judgement. But one thing is decidable and it is the thing that ruins a title screen:
whether the regions the layout reserved are quiet enough to set text on. A beautiful
painting with a busy centre is an unusable title screen, and no reviewer should have to
catch that and no author can prevent it by prompting. So the gate measures each reserved
region — over the drift range the host may move the layers through, not one still frame —
for flatness and for contrast against white and black.

An **emblem** is a cut-out: one shape on air, with a transparent exterior, sized to sit
in the mark band beside the wordmark. Its gate is the icon grid's, on a bigger canvas.

Everything else about a plate is the reviewer's: style coherence with the references, and
that nothing legible got drawn despite the prompt refusing to ask for it.
