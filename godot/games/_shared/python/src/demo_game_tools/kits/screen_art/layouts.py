"""The shell's screen geometry: what a layout id resolves to, and what it reserves.

A layout id is the whole authored geometry, exactly as it is for a UI atlas role: a
package names a layout and never writes a rectangle. What is different here is *why*
the rectangles exist. A UI role's cells say where the art goes; a shell layout's rects
say where the art must **stay out of the way** — the band the wordmark is set in, the
column the control stack occupies, the strip a card or a tip is read from. They are
reserved regions, and the gate measures them on the plate the model returned.

Every shell plate is one 2560 by 1440 canvas: the native 16:9 size the bound image
route already draws for the universe workflow's wide modes (its ``size_by_mode``
table), so this family invents no raster shape.

Rects are canvas pixels. A consumer scales the whole canvas to its window and scales
every rect by the same factor, so nothing here is a screen size.
