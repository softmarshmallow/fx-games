"""Provider-neutral platformer map design: capabilities, chunk grammar, validator, designer.

WHAT THIS IS. A description of what a 2D side-scrolling game can express (:mod:`capabilities`),
a grammar that composes a map as a left-to-right sentence of named set-pieces (:mod:`grammar`),
a deterministic expander plus the validator that judges the result against those capabilities
(:mod:`design`), and the feedback that quotes the validator's own complaints back to a composer
(:mod:`designer`).

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a generator: it produces no images, audio, or packaged artifacts,
and it schedules no work. It is not a renderer: it never sees a pixel, a camera, a viewport, or
an engine, and every measurement it makes is in tiles. It is not a recipe or an adapter: it owns
no composition, layout, or runtime assumption. And it knows no specific game -- there is not one
game constant in this package. Every threshold, symbol, climbable variant, and biome tag arrives
in the :class:`PlatformerProfile` a caller hands it, which is the only reason one designer can
serve a fixed-rise ground-founded platformer and a chained-shaft metroidvania without a branch.
