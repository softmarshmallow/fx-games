"""Chunk grammar: the map as a sentence of parameterized set-pieces.

Lineage is Dormans' mission/space grammars: a designer composes named patterns, and the
patterns own their internal correctness. The model emits a left-to-right sequence of chunks
-- runs, staircases, hollows, ladder-fed perches, chained towers, jump chains -- and a
deterministic expander turns each into terrain, platforms, and climbables. Nothing here is
absolute-positioned: every chunk advances a cursor, so the model composes purely in pacing.

What this buys over a walk-the-map encoding:
  - VERTICAL set-pieces are first-class words (tower, hop_chain, shelves), countering the
    measured bias of walk-the-map encodings toward horizontal choreography. Shelves are the
    one word that stacks decks over the SAME columns, and each of its tiers is a lane rather
    than a single deck, which is what a hunting map's storeys are made of; every other chunk
    owns its columns alone.
  - the vocabulary is PROFILE-FILTERED: a tower is only in the grammar when the profile lets
    climbables stand on platforms, so a game's grammar only contains what it can build.
  - validator feedback is TRANSLATED back into chunk vocabulary. A grid encoding loses maps
    because the validator complains about surface ids the model never saw; here every emitted
    column remembers the chunk that produced it.

Total width: chunks that fall short of the map are finished with an implicit flat run (a
format semantic, like RLE right-padding); chunks that overflow are an error naming the chunk
where the map ran out.
