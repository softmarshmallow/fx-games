"""Bring one actor's motion atlases into agreement with each other.

An actor's states are generated in separate provider calls, and separate calls do not share a
scale. The published atlases therefore disagree about how large the character is drawn, and the
disagreement is invisible in the alpha: a crouch is shorter because of the pose, a mis-scaled
sheet is shorter because of the artwork, and a bounding box cannot tell those apart.

This module answers exactly one question - is this the same character, drawn at the same scale,
as the baseline? - and answers it as a ratio. It deliberately does not answer how big the
character is; that is a magnitude, it is authored, and it belongs to the asset unit.

The contract is `docs/spec/motion-rebase.md`. Plate composition is provider-neutral and lives in
`fx_games.media.comparison_plate`; what a group means is decided here.
