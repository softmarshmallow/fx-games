"""Turn one returned painting into the raster that ships, and prove what it is.

Publication does three things, in this order, and the order is the whole design:

1. crop the segment's own columns out of the conditioning canvas, discarding the context
   columns the model was shown but never asked to own;
2. clip the painting's alpha to the outward edge of the silhouette band, so nothing can
   reach a hop gap or hang a support under a deck however the model felt about it;
3. lay a deterministic material under whatever the model did not paint, so a cell it
   skipped publishes as material rather than as a hole in the floor.

Step three is the one with a trap in it, and the runner already paid for the lesson: a
returned painting ramps its alpha over four or five pixels at every edge, and compositing
that ramp straight onto a base built from the guide's own colours publishes a
guide-coloured hairline along the row the player walks on. So the painting goes down
twice -- its opaque core grown outward first to put its own colour under the whole rim,
then the painting itself at its true alpha over that. The edge keeps the softness the
model drew and fades into its own material.

The base is built on the band's *inner* edge rather than on the occupancy, which makes it
strictly safer here than in the runner: deterministic material can no longer surface
anywhere near a silhouette, because it stops eight pixels short of one.
