"""Deterministic guide and canonicalizer for bespoke runner ground paintings.

The image model is allowed to paint material and authored silhouette detail;
it is never allowed to author geometry. A local guide gives it the segment's
binary occupancy plus identical apron treatment at both ends. One shared local
node canonicalizes the first generated segment's right two-column apron into a
bridge. Publication gives every chunk complementary roles from that bridge:
bridge column zero is its right edge and bridge column one is its left edge.
Any A-to-B join therefore reconstructs the generated two-column bridge while
collision remains entirely owned by the authored grid.

#: A top-exposed cell is the walking surface, and it must be painted nearly
#: whole. Where the provider leaves a solid cell transparent, the
#: canonicalizer's deterministic material fallback fills it - and that fallback
#: is built from the guide's own cap and fill colours, so unpainted ground
#: publishes AS guide material. Measured on the played v9 run,
#: `rescue_calibration`'s top row came back 0.63 covered and the missing third
#: shipped as a flat lilac band along the row the avatar stands on. The 0.20
#: floor this replaced admitted a cell four fifths made of fallback.
#:
#: It stays a gross floor. Deriving it from how far publication can reach was
#: tried and put it at 0.90625, exactly where a normal four-to-five-pixel alpha
#: ramp lands: it refused correct paintings about half the time and burned a
#: segment's whole retry budget. A coverage over a source cell is a proxy in any
#: case, and what the rule cares about - whether guide colour reaches the
#: published raster - is measured directly below.
_MIN_SOURCE_TOP_CELL_COVERAGE: Final = 0.85

#: How much of any published row may still be untouched deterministic base. The
#: defect this refuses is a line, so it is measured by row rather than over the
#: raster: the hairline that shipped was four fifths of one scanline on a tile
#: measuring 0.0075 overall. Identity with the base rather than nearness to a
#: guide colour, because proximity can only speak about the cap - the guide's
#: fill is the material's own dark and honest art wears it - which left the same
#: defect at the bottom edge invisible: one shipped tile published a
#: fourteen-pixel band of base along its last rows and another published its
#: final row.
_MAX_PUBLISHED_BASE_ROW_SHARE: Final = 0.10

#: How far the painting's own colour is grown under the bare rim it leaves.
#: Six published pixels covers the four-to-five-pixel alpha ramp measured at the
#: top of every Iron Petal slab, and it is deliberately no wider: the nearest
#: paint at a slab's top edge is its dark ink contour, so six pixels reads as
#: that contour while twelve reads as a smear. A rim wider than this cannot be
#: repaired here at any reach - widening only trades a lilac band for a dark one
#: - which is why the published check above refuses it rather than this one
#: stretching to cover it.
_PAINT_EDGE_EXTENSION_PX: Final = 6

#: Saturation at which a pixel counts as a feature rather than base material.
_MIN_INCIDENT_SATURATION: Final = 90

#: How close a painted pixel may sit to a guide colour before it counts as
#: guide showing through, as a Chebyshev distance in RGB.
#:
#: The existing coverage checks cannot see this at all: they count painted
#: pixels at alpha >= 128, and every guide pixel is opaque, so they measure
#: ALPHA rather than AUTHORSHIP. A model that paints around the guide instead
#: of over it passes them completely - which is how a measured 23 of the
#: walk-surface row's 64 pixels shipped as unpainted guide.
_MAX_GUIDE_RESIDUE_DISTANCE: Final = 10

#: The share of a painted region that may sit within that distance. Non-zero
#: because a bespoke painting is free to arrive at a colour near the guide's
#: honestly, and the guide's palette is derived from the authored material.
_MAX_GUIDE_RESIDUE_SHARE: Final = 0.06

#: Under a parallel projection every receding edge runs the same way, so one
#: tile must not carry two receding families that disagree. Both halves of that
#: sentence are now enforceable, because a third only speaks when it has a
#: family at all: measured per third, correct Iron Petal art concentrates its
#: diagonal energy at 0.016 to 0.339 and never reaches the floor below, while
#: the same tiles hatched into an opposite-leaning splay reach 0.581 at the
#: median. So every shipped tile is silent here and refuses nothing, and every
#: splay speaks with a spread of 73.2 to 84.9 degrees.
#:
#: The first version of this constant sat at 68, in a gap between correct art
#: and the controls, because the lean was read from thirds that had no family
#: and were reporting the mean of noise: `raised_bed` cleared it by a tenth of
#: a degree. A statistic that has to be given that much room is measuring the
#: wrong thing, and this one now abstains instead.
_MAX_PROJECTION_LEAN_SPREAD_DEGREES: Final = 30.0

#: Leans below this are read as horizontal detail rather than a receding edge,
#: and leans this close to vertical are structural uprights. Both are excluded
#: before the family's lean is taken.
_MIN_PROJECTION_LEAN_DEGREES: Final = 8.0
_MAX_PROJECTION_LEAN_DEGREES: Final = 82.0

#: Below this gradient magnitude a pixel is flat material rather than an edge.
_MIN_PROJECTION_EDGE_MAGNITUDE: Final = 24

#: Below this many qualifying edge pixels a third has nothing to say, and a
#: flat material is not a projection failure.
_MIN_PROJECTION_EDGE_SAMPLES: Final = 64

#: How concentrated a third's diagonal energy must be before it counts as a
#: receding FAMILY rather than scattered detail. Without it the reported lean is
#: the circular mean of noise, which wanders freely and makes any tolerance
#: above it arbitrary.
_MIN_PROJECTION_FAMILY_CONCENTRATION: Final = 0.40


#: How the lean estimator reads gradients. Pillow's kernel filter clamps its
#: output into the image's own range, so the 8-bit `offset=128` pair this began
#: with saturated on every strong edge and dropped it into the +-45 degree bin:
#: synthetic parallel edges drawn at 20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 degrees all measured
#: 45.0, and every shipped tile reported a spread of exactly zero. Signed
#: gradients need the 32-bit `I` mode and an offset with headroom under them,
#: and orientation has to be read above the pixel staircase of an aliased edge,
#: which is what the blur is for.
