"""The authored half of the painted ground mode.

A map that names this mode is asking for its terrain to be painted rather than tiled. It
says what the material is and nothing about where the paint may go: the silhouette
tolerance is a property of the family, published so a consumer can reason about it, and
never a knob an author turns. That follows the same rule the spawn contract already
follows -- a package names a word, the consumer owns the numbers.
