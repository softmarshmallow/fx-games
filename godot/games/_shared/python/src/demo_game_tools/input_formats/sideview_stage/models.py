"""The side-view stage: the map blocks every side-scrolling genre shares.

A side-view game, whatever its genre, presents one horizontal plane the camera
travels along: a view profile, a continuity rule for the layers that loop past
it, the references those layers are drawn from, the layers themselves, and the
ground the actors stand on. The platformer authors these blocks in its map
document and the runner in its track segments; both read them from here, so
neither genre component imports the other.

Persisted ``kind``/``mode`` strings are unchanged by this home: module paths
are never persisted, so a rehome costs no run.
