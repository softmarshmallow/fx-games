"""Resolve one authored scenario offline: read, prove, refuse, then materialize.

The order is the point, and it is `resolve_pointclick_room`'s order: parse the
declarations, read the script and hold it to its digest, compile, and prove -
*before* anything downstream is built and long before a provider is reached. A
scenario that cannot be finished costs nothing.

The two halves are one authored member. `scenario.toml` names the script by path
and pins it with `script_sha256`, exactly as `[[references]]` pins an image, and
they are admitted together or not at all.
