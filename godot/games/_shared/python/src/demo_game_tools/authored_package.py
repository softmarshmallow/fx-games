"""Read one member of an authored package, confined to it and bound to its digest.

Every authored package here has the same shape: an operator names a root directory
on the command line, and a document inside it names further members by relative
path. That is an author-controlled path pointing into an operator-controlled tree,
so the read is confined rather than trusted, and the bytes are matched against the
digest the author recorded before anything parses them.

This exists because three contracts needed exactly these rules. The dialogue scene
and the point-and-click room each grew their own near-identical copy, and both
copies were weaker than they read: `resolve_relative_path_within_root` is lexical,
so the `is_symlink()` guard that followed it only ever inspected the FINAL path
component - an intermediate symlinked directory was accepted - and there was a
window between that check and `read_bytes()` in which the file could be replaced.
Routing every member read through `read_relative_regular_file` opens each ancestor
with `O_NOFOLLOW` instead, so the check and the read are the same operation.
