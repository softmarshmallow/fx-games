# Authored game soundtracks

> **Scope: game consumers.** This document describes the formats used by these Godot games.
> The public asset SDK and new games do not require this authoring format.

> **Contract maturity: exact-current prepared-package contract.**

The platformer root `soundtrack.toml`, or a runner member's
`runner/soundtrack.toml`, is that genre member's catalog of music identities,
creative briefs, generation intent, and playback policy. Its exact identity is
`game-soundtrack-v1`. The package root names it by exact source path; gameplay
references its tracks by `track_id`; the prepared scrolling DAG generates and
validates one audio artifact per track.

## Ownership

| Owner | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `soundtrack.toml` | Track identity, display name, creative brief, duration/loop intent, and global selection policy |
| `game.toml` | Exact soundtrack source path |
| `gameplay.toml` | Which maps, encounters, or bosses use which track IDs |
| The game's FX build | Route selection (the game's `fx.yaml`), generation, decoding, and validation; FX keeps the run record and cache identity |
| Consumer | Audio unlock, volume, playback lifecycle, map changes, and deterministic selection within authored policy |
| Genre audio contract | What the music does at gameplay edges - the runner's `[music]` transitions in `runner/audio.toml`, see [game-sound-effects.md](../../iron_petal_unit/docs/audio.md) |

Maps do not embed soundtrack briefs or artifacts. A map is visual/static
composition; gameplay owns its track usage.

## Current source

```toml
schema_version = 1
kind = "game-soundtrack-v1"
game_id = "example-game"
revision = 1

[playback]
selection = "shuffle"
no_immediate_repeat = true

[[tracks]]
track_id = "village_morning"
display_name = "Village Morning"
creative_brief = "An original warm instrumental for a bright social village."

[tracks.generation]
intent = "generate"
instrumental = true
seamless_loop = true
target_duration_seconds = 90

[[tracks]]
track_id = "forest_road"
display_name = "Forest Road"
creative_brief = "An original light-adventure instrumental for open-air exploration."

[tracks.generation]
intent = "generate"
instrumental = true
seamless_loop = true
target_duration_seconds = 105
```

The catalog requires two to 64 unique `lower_snake_case` track IDs. Track
order is not semantic because V1 selection is shuffle; canonicalization sorts
by ID. Creative text is trimmed and provider-neutral. Each generation block is
exactly original instrumental generation, seamless-loop intent, and a target
duration from 15 through 600 seconds.

## Package and execution

The platformer package path is `soundtrack.toml`; a runner uses
`runner/soundtrack.toml`. Each is selected by its genre member's `[soundtrack]`
entry in `game.toml`. Prepared-package resolution validates the catalog, every
gameplay track reference where that family has one, and the complete closure
before paid work.

For each track, the game's build writes three steps
(`demo_game_tools.steps.soundtrack`):

```text
soundtrack.<track_id>.generate   draw the track (fx/music.generate@1)
soundtrack.<track_id>.admit      a playable MP3, or it is drawn again, at most six takes
soundtrack.<track_id>.record     measure it, refuse one shorter than 15 seconds, record it
```

Generation publishes `soundtrack/<track_id>.mp3`, which the `package` step lays out with
the rest of the runtime package; the runner also publishes the measured record beside it
as `soundtrack/<track_id>.validation.json`. The route is the game's `fx.yaml`
(`music.generate`) and never appears in authored TOML.

Provider-free integration projects playback policy and each track’s stable ID,
display name, duration, artifact path, digest, and byte count into
`prepared-game-runtime-v12`. The prepared consumer validates that exact closure,
then plays the first track assigned to the current map and restarts selection
when the map changes. Browser autoplay restrictions remain consumer behavior.
The runner consumer additionally performs the fades, pauses, and ducks its
genre's audio contract authors at death, restart, and hurt; this catalog says
nothing about them.

## Validation

Validate the complete canonical package, including soundtrack cross-references:

```sh
uv run --group games demo-games package validate --input godot/games/bellweather/inputs/default
(cd godot/games/bellweather && uv run python -m grida.fx plan pipeline/workflow.py:build --arg package=inputs/default)
```

Contract validity does not prove listening quality. Generated audio still needs
separate listening review before any quality or publication claim.

See [Canonical prepared game package](game-package.md) for closure rules and
[Canonical game-generation pipeline](../../bellweather/docs/generation-pipeline.md) for the
executable DAG.
