# Authored game contract schema

Scope: retained game-owned input/readers, not a universal gameplay or asset SDK
contract. Existing v2 scenario fields remain production-adapter inputs. The
[current Scenario invocation contract](../../../../packages/scenario_runtime/docs/contract.md) independently owns v3
narrative semantics and optional presentation profiles; it is not governed by
this reader's genre, staging, camera or host taxonomy.

> **Scope: game consumers.** This document describes the formats used by these Godot games.
> The public asset SDK and new games do not require this authoring format.

> **Checked by:** `tests/contract/test_current_game_docs.py`, `tests/contract/test_docs_check.py`, `tests/contract/test_generation_pipeline_docs.py`.

> **Contract maturity: exact-current prepared-package root.**
>
> This document specifies `game-contract-v9`, the root `game.toml` accepted by
> prepared-package ingest. The complete package closure and transport rules live
> in [Canonical prepared game package](../game-package.md); execution order
> and provider fan-out live in the [Canonical generation pipeline](../../../bellweather/docs/generation-pipeline.md).

## Purpose

`game.toml` is the genre-neutral container for one prepared game, naming every
member by exact source path. The container owns what every genre of the game
must share - identity, universe, style, proportion, scale, evidence, and rights
- and declares one or more `[[genres]]` members. Each genre member owns what is
genre-scoped: its camera (`presentation`), its cast roles, and its own contract
member table. The root does not contain generated paths, provider
configuration, execution order, map-use rules, or runtime objects.

The canonical path is:

```text
godot/games/<game>/inputs/game.toml
```

Only `schema_version = 9` and `kind = "game-contract-v9"` are accepted. The
resolver does not translate another document shape.

## Root shape

The exact fields are:

```toml

# nothing omits the section and ships no projectile artwork.
[genres.content.projectiles]

# A runner member owns its own fixed runner/ closure. Audio is required so no

## Field invariants

- `game_id` is a portable game identifier and agrees with the selected package
  identity; `revision` is at least one and `display_name` is trimmed text.
- `genres` declares one to eight members, each a distinct genre. Platformer and
  runner have distinct member models; contract members are exclusively owned
  by one genre, while digest-locked reference images may be shared across
  members.
- A member's presentation is currently exactly `side_view_2d` in `side_plane` gameplay
  space. `contact_shadows` is a consumer-only grounding treatment: `opacity`
  is zero through one and `softness_screen_pixels` is zero through 32.
- Style keywords and avoidances are ordered, unique, trimmed lists. Their order
  is prompt-significant.
- Default and body-specific proportions are between 1.5 and 12 heads tall.
- `scale` states the game's size vocabulary. `unit` is exactly `player_height`: the player
  is `1.0` by definition and every other subject declares `height_units` as a multiple of
  it. `player_height_tiles` is the one place the unit meets a render projection.
  `minimum` is the legibility floor nothing interactive resolves below, `steps` is an
  ascending unique ladder at or above that floor, and `[scale.ranks]` maps a mob rank to a
  magnitude so silhouette height carries threat. `scale` and `proportion` answer different
  questions and are never reconciled: magnitude is a property of the world, build is a
  property of the art style.
- Player, mob, and NPC IDs are unique `lower_snake_case` identifiers. Cast IDs
  must resolve to their respective content catalogs. `content.projectiles` is
  optional; when declared it must resolve to `content/projectiles.toml`.
- The universe, gameplay, UI, soundtrack, runner audio, content, and sequence-catalog paths
  have fixed package-relative locations.
- Every map source is exactly `maps/<map_id>.toml`; map IDs and sources are
  unique.
- Evidence keys are `lower_snake_case`. Each evidence triple lives under
  `references/`, uses the required provenance/review suffixes, and is unique.
- Evidence digests are authored: each artifact, provenance, and review file is
  bound by the SHA-256 of its exact reviewed bytes. Member digests are computed
  at ingest and are never authored here. Unknown fields are rejected.
- Rights status is `unreviewed`, `restricted`, or
  `redistribution-approved`; the nonempty basis records authored-input rights,
  not generated-media publication approval.

## Composition boundaries

The root catalogs subordinate contracts; it does not absorb their fields:

| Contract | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| `gameplay.toml` | Movement, entry map, transition relationships, population, combat, loot, interactions, quests, and effects; optionally `[score]` (points per scored occurrence) and `[timers]` (timers whose end is a session edge), the two blocks a minigame variant authors |
| `ui.toml` | Generated interface presentation and layout |
| `maps/<map_id>.toml` | Visual/static map composition, terrain occupancy, ladder placement, and portal presentation/anchors |
| Content catalogs | Player, mob, NPC, prop, item, and projectile identities, visual references, motion presentation, the player's drawn equipment, and NPC catalog-wide world orientation |
| `soundtrack.toml` | Track identities, creative briefs, and playback policy |
| `runner/audio.toml` | Runner event-to-effect bindings and portable effect realizations: oscillator sweeps, generated clips, and spoken lines, each bought kind with a `take` ordinal and an optional pinned, digest-locked take under `runner/audio/` |
| `voices.toml` | The game-global voice catalog: each `voice_id` a spoken line may name, its language and casting note, its rights statement, and the provider voice it resolves to |
| `runner/track.toml` | Authored runner occupancy, hazards, pickups, parallax layers, and the closed atlas/structural-ground presentation mode |
| `runner/content/avatar.toml` | One runner actor, its chronological visible-person age, single-character or visible-rider-machine silhouette basis, references, and motion playback |
| Sequence catalog and sources | Dialogue/cutscene graph and outcomes |

In particular, a map owns ladder and portal composition per map, while
`gameplay.toml` owns climb permission and portal destinations. Gameplay
`crouch` authorizes the posture; the player catalog supplies its motion frames
and playback contract. Gameplay `[combat] weapon_class` says how the character
fights (`melee_dps_v1`, `melee_sweep_v1`, or `ranged_dps_v1`) and
`[combat] number_scale` how large the numbers read (`unit_v1` or `arcade_v1`);
the player catalog's `equipment` says what they are drawn carrying.
Both are closed names, so unlike the pairings above this one is enforced rather
than merely owned: for a combat-enabled package, resolution rejects a
combination the vocabularies do not admit as `player_equipment_mismatch`.

## Resolution and projection

Prepared-package resolution captures the selected directory or ZIP once,
computes every member digest at capture, validates all cross-contract
identities locally, and rejects malformed input before a provider operation.
The common resolver accepts runner-only and platformer-containing roots;
platformer execution uses an explicit platformer-required narrowing rather
than making that genre an accidental prerequisite of every package.
Membership stays exact: a member named here but absent is rejected as
`missing_package_file`, and a captured file no contract names is rejected as
`orphan_package_file`. Resolution then digests the exact captured closure of
every member path, digest, and byte size as `closure_sha256`, which appears in
the `resolved-game-package-v6` identity and in the
`game-package-validation-v6` report.
The selected genre DAG consumes this resolved package. Platformer integration
emits `prepared-game-runtime-v12`; runner integration emits
`sideview-runner-runtime-v13`.

Validate the canonical package with:

```sh
uv run --group games demo-games package validate --input godot/games/bellweather/inputs/default
uv run --group games demo-games package digest --input godot/games/bellweather/inputs/default
(cd godot/games/bellweather && uv run python -m grida.fx plan pipeline/workflow.py:build --arg package=inputs/default)
```

The executable authority is
`godot/games/_shared/python/src/demo_game_tools/input_formats/game_contract/package.py` together with
`godot/tools/python/src/demo_game_collection/game_package.py`, which composes each genre's
member resolution from its game's `<game>_pipeline/validation.py`. The canonical Bellweather source
is the integration fixture; documentation examples do not replace executable
validation.
