Method: every `speaker "text"` line and every narration string in the adaptation is
matched against the parsed dialogue and action prose of
`story/snapshot-2026-09-03/script/chapter-01..06-*.fountain` by exact string compare
after Unicode/whitespace normalisation, with a fuzzy second pass to catch alterations,
and every survivor is then read by hand against the outline's permitted-new-writing
list, the cast bible and `FACTS.md`.

Checker: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-universe-Documents-shared-stage-gen/4456a1a9-1c38-49b2-84d8-30d4fd469f44/scratchpad/verify.py`

## Status board — text lane CLOSED

All seven defects raised against the scripts have been fixed by the writers and
re-audited. **Every beat now passes on all four axes.**

| Beat | Attribution | Verbatim | Fixed sentences | Fact ids | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `e1_office` | clean | clean | clean | n/a | **pass** |
| `rooms/motor_court` | clean | clean | n/a | clean | **pass** |
| `e1_way_in` | clean | clean | n/a | clean | **pass** |
| `e1_table` | clean | clean | clean | clean | **pass** |
| `e1_coffee` | clean | clean | clean | clean | **pass** — D2 fixed |
| `rooms/window` | clean | clean | n/a | clean | **pass** — polish item fixed |
| `e1_the_court` | clean | clean | n/a | clean | **pass** — D1 fixed |
| `e1_statements` | clean | clean | clean | clean | **pass** — D3–D6 fixed |

**No line of dialogue anywhere is attributed to the wrong person.** Checked
mechanically across all six scenarios and both rooms and then read by hand; every
apparent hit was a short generic cue ("All right.", "Why?", "I did.") colliding with an
unrelated novel line, not a misattribution.

**No fixed sentence is altered.** A sweep for every variant of the "That is not what I
asked" family across all six scenarios and both rooms returns exactly one survivor:
Ward's "That isn't what I asked.", said once.

All six admit under `scenario check`: `e1_office` 8 states, `e1_way_in` 7,
`e1_table` 42, `e1_coffee` 41, `e1_the_court` 40727, `e1_statements` 14565.

### How each defect closed

| # | Fix, as verified |
|---|---|
| D1 | `e1_the_court:335` now reads `henry "I didn't look at it."` — the unearned sighting is gone |
| D2 | the contradicting narration is cut from `place_table`; only the lifted line at `e1_coffee:40` remains |
| D3 | "That is not what I asked either." cut; Ward's exact form survives once |
| D4 | Nell's cue cut from `nell_silence` |
| D5 | `told_ruth_what_i_saw` added to `FACTS.md:115` and declared in the case; three answers, three records |
| D6 | fixed better than proposed — `henry "I don't think so."` restored after "Did she drink?", and the other path split into `return_kept_unwatched`, where Ward says "You didn't watch the cup and you don't think she was frightened." Both paths are now true |
| D7 | case `reads`/`writes` corrected; `case check` passes bound, 8 beats, 69 facts |
| gap 1 | `descent_indicator` — `henry "Three is the last I saw of either of them."` / `ward writing "Three."` |
| gap 2 | `envelope_corroborated` — `ward writing "She told me the same thing an hour ago."`, with Henry's "I was watching his coat." keeping him out of inference |
| polish | `rooms/window:277` — "He does not pull it free." replaced by "The rest of the line is under the hand.", which makes the second interaction a temptation rather than a contradiction |

## Fixed sentences — audit

Line numbers refreshed after the fix round.

| Sentence | Where | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| "I remembered you were a liar." | `e1_office.scenario:27`, Ruth | exact |
| "Watch my coffee." | `e1_coffee.scenario:412`, Ruth | exact |
| "He said not to wait." | `e1_coffee.scenario:583`, Ruth → Nell | exact |
| "He said he needed to think." | `e1_coffee.scenario:605`, Ruth → Henry | exact |
| both of the above, quoted back to Ward | `e1_statements.scenario:500`, Henry | exact, both in one cue |
| "Would you have come?" | `e1_table.scenario:429`, Lydia → Ruth | exact — the first counting |
| "Would you have come?" | `e1_statements.scenario:891`, Lydia → Nell | exact — the second counting, with Nell's "You already used that excuse tonight." intact two lines later |
| "I don't know." | `e1_statements.scenario:199`, Henry | exact, and the whole answer — nothing appended |
| "It is what I saw." | `e1_statements.scenario:422`, Henry | exact |
| "That isn't what I asked." | `e1_statements.scenario:420`, Ward | exact, and now the only one |

Two altered instances were found in the first audit and have since been cut — Ward's
"That is not what I asked either." (D3) and Nell's "That is not what I asked you."
(D4). The defect write-ups are kept below for the evidence trail; both are closed.

Episode One spends two of the three countings of "Would you have come?", which matches
`FACTS.md` as amended (R-02). Both are Lydia's, and neither is gated behind a look.

### The deliberate discrepancies are intact

All three of Ruth's accounts are present and all three are distinct. Nothing has been
harmonised:

- `e1_coffee.scenario:583` — "He said not to wait." to Nell
- `e1_coffee.scenario:605` — "He said he needed to think." to Henry, the same minute
- `e1_statements.scenario:696` — "…He said he needed time, and I left him beside the
  display door." after one in the morning, inside Ruth's Sc13 speech, lifted whole

`e1_statements.scenario:706` states the three back to back and ends "Henry says none of
that out loud", which is the Henry rule holding in Ruth's hearing. Correct, and the best
line of new narration in the episode.

# Defects

Most severe first.

## D3 — `e1_statements.scenario:472`: a fixed sentence altered (serious)

```
label paul_words_kept:
    henry "She said he was downstairs with the carton."
    ward "That is not what I asked either."
```

The sentence is **"That isn't what I asked."** (`chapter-06:310`). This is the exact
failure the brief names. Two changes: the contraction is expanded, and a word is
appended. Eighty-eight lines earlier the same file says it correctly (`:384`), so the
scenario contains the same fixed sentence in two forms.

It is worse than a smoothing, because the novel varies this sentence deliberately and
by speaker across the whole book, and `That is not what I asked.` is a form that is
already spoken by somebody else, later:

| Chapter | Speaker | Form |
|---|---|---|
| `chapter-06:310` | Ward | That isn't what I asked. |
| `chapter-08:295` | Nell | That was not what I asked. |
| `chapter-12:479` | Nell | That is not what I asked. |
| `chapter-14:109` | Ward | That is not what I asked. |
| `chapter-14:860` | Ruth | That isn't what I asked you for. |

Ward's shift from `isn't` to `is not` happens in Chapter Fourteen. Spending it in
Episode One flattens a variation the book takes eight chapters to earn.

**Fix:** either say it exactly — `ward "That isn't what I asked."` — or, since it would
then be the second time in one interview, drop the line and let Ward's
`"You are allowed to be tired, Calder."` at `:476` carry the beat alone. QA's
preference is the second: the fixed sentence lands harder used once.

## D4 — `e1_statements.scenario:809`: a fixed sentence altered, and given to the wrong episode (serious)

```
label nell_silence:
    henry "The police have his clothing. They will tell you what they found."
    nell "That is not what I asked you."
```

Three problems, compounding:

1. **Altered.** Nell's form of this sentence is "That is not what I asked."
   (`chapter-12:479`). `:809` appends "you".
2. **Premature.** Nell does not say any form of it until `chapter-08:295`, in Episode
   Two. Episode One's Nell has not yet started correcting people this way; it is part
   of what Thursday does to her.
3. **Outside the permitted list.** The outline's Sc14 gives Nell no new cue at all —
   the only new writing it authorises for the car is "Nell's car without the turn:
   action only, no new cue."

**Fix:** cut the cue. `henry "The police have his clothing. They will tell you what
they found."` followed by the existing `henry "No."` does not work without it, so the
label becomes Henry's line and then straight to `lydia_speaks`. Nell's silence is the
point of choosing silence.

## D5 — `e1_statements.scenario:668`: an invented fact id (serious)

```
label elevators_what_i_saw:
    ...
    set told_ruth_what_i_saw
```

`told_ruth_what_i_saw` appears nowhere in `FACTS.md` and nowhere in
`cases/episode_one.toml`'s fact list. It is declared only in `e1_statements.toml:...`
and set only here. `FACTS.md`'s own rule: *"if a writer needs an id this table does not
have, they add a row here and tell the lead, they do not invent one privately."*

`FACTS.md` already carries `told_ruth_after_one` — "what Henry gave Ruth beside the
passenger elevators" — and the scenario uses that one on the *third* answer
(`:684`) and nothing on the first. So the three answers currently write, in order:
nothing / an invented id / the canonical id.

**Fix, for the lead rather than the writer,** because it is a ledger question: either
(a) all three answers set `told_ruth_after_one` and the distinction is dropped, or
(b) `FACTS.md` gains a row for the middle answer and the case declares it. The outline
says the third answer specifically "is carried as a fact for Thursday morning to
answer", which argues for (b) only if Thursday needs to tell the three apart.

## D6 — `e1_statements.scenario:410`: Ward refers to a first time that was deleted (medium)

```
label return_kept:
    henry "I don't think so."
    ward "That is the second time tonight you have not thought so."
```

There is no first time on either path into this label. The cause is upstream, at
`:345`:

```
label return_ward_knows:
    ward "You said she touched it to her mouth."
    henry "Yes."
    ward "Did she drink?"
    ward blunt "Was she frightened?"        <- Henry never answers "Did she drink?"
```

The novel (`chapter-06:297–307`) has Ward ask "Did she drink?", Henry answer **"I don't
think so."**, and only then "Was she frightened?". The lifted answer has been dropped,
so Ward asks two questions with nothing between them, and the new line at `:410` loses
its referent.

**Fix:** restore `henry "I don't think so."` between `:350` and `:352`. That repairs
both problems at once — it puts back a lifted line, it stops Ward interrogating
himself, and it makes `:410` literally true, because the menu's "I don't think so."
then genuinely is the second time. The other path (`return_ward_asks`, `:363`) still
needs a different line at `:410`, since there Henry said "I didn't watch the cup." —
suggest routing `return_kept` per path, or rewording to something that fits both.

## D1 — `e1_the_court.scenario:335`: Henry reports a look he never took (medium)

*Confirmed by the lead, routed to writer B. Recorded here for the evidence trail.*

```
label court_paper_unread:
    henry "I saw it under his hand. I didn't read it."
```

Fires when `heading_int_bedroom` is false. Nothing in the window room puts paper in
Henry's sight otherwise — `rooms/window/room.toml:216` stops at the shoe, the hand and
the clothing. Suggested: `henry "I didn't look at it."`

## D2 — `e1_coffee.scenario:325`: new narration contradicting a lifted line (low-medium)

*Confirmed by the lead, routed to writer B.*

"From the table the round table is still the shape of the room…" against the novel's
own line carried verbatim at `:40`: "…and soon the round table is no longer the shape
of the room."

## D7 — the case's authored `reads`/`writes` do not match the leaves (medium, contract lane)

`cases/episode_one.toml` declares reads and writes by hand, and the file's own comment
says that is so "a leaf that stops exporting a fact fails against the case that depends
on it". Five declarations are currently wrong, so that guard is not armed:

| Beat | Problem |
|---|---|
| `b_the_court` | `reads` omits `bell_in_receiving`, which `e1_the_court.toml` imports and `e1_the_court.scenario:382` tests |
| `b_statements` | `reads` omits `asked_paul_sentence` (`:621`), `carton_on_gallery` (`:764`, `:768`) and `heading_int_bedroom` (`:764`, `:766`) |
| `b_statements` | `reads` lists `paul_not_to_wait` and `paul_needed_to_think`, which the scenario does not import and does not test |
| `b_statements` | `writes` omits `told_ruth_what_i_saw` — a consequence of D5, and it resolves with D5 |

Nothing here breaks at runtime, because every missing read is written by an earlier
beat on every path. It is the declaration that is wrong, which is the thing that was
supposed to catch the next mistake.

---

# Gaps: two paid-for looks that nothing reads

Not defects in a line, but the outline promises these and Episode One does not deliver
them. Both are looks the player must actively choose and pay a course of attention for.

- **`indicator_at_three`** — set at `e1_coffee.scenario:434`. The outline's Sc12 beat
  table lists it under **The descent**: "Who came down in the lift? | Paul and Ruth;
  the indicator at three". The statement's descent beat
  (`e1_statements.scenario:318–329`) has no menu and no `if`, and Henry never mentions
  the indicator. The board table calls it "the last thing he saw of them".
- **`ruth_two_fingers`** — set at `e1_coffee.scenario:368`. The outline's Sc12 beat
  table lists it under **The envelope**: "Nell's name upside down; 'Hear it'; Ruth's
  two fingers (if seen)". `e1_statements.scenario:247` gates the envelope beat on
  `envelope_hear_it` alone, and the two fingers are never offered. The board table says
  it buys "'It was in his inside pocket when we went down,' corroborated" — and Ruth
  says exactly that line at `e1_statements.scenario:63`, so the corroboration is sitting
  right there unused.

Every other Episode One fact that nothing reads is one the outline marks as paying off
later (the strands, `dark_blue_door` → Ch16, `pocketknife_lent` → Thursday's fan,
`chalk_and_scissors` → "a rhyme on Friday", `handbag_under_arm` → "where the pages
went"), or is unmissable and therefore never needs testing. Those are correct.

---

# Minor findings and suggestions

## `e1_statements.scenario`

- **:699** — the menu option is labelled `"He said he needed time."`, which reads as a
  line Henry is about to speak, but the body (`:706`) is Henry noticing in silence and
  ends "Henry says none of that out loud." Suggest relabelling to something that reads
  as attention rather than speech, e.g. `"Count the accounts."` The body is right; the
  label promises the wrong thing, and this is the one place in the episode where the
  player is offered the chain that ends in Chapter Fifteen.
- **:289** — `henry "Mr. Price laid it beside his fork while the cinnamon was going
  round. He said, after dessert."` Ward then asks "Those words?" and Henry confirms
  "Those words." Edwin's line is `"After dessert."` (`chapter-03:436`). Since the
  exactness is the point of the exchange, suggest quoting it as written rather than
  running it into the sentence.
- **:183, :311, :414, :462** — Ward answers four separate beats with `"All right."` It
  is new writing and permitted, but the cast bible gives Ward "blunt, one joke", not a
  verbal tic, and four identical closes will read as one on a play-through. Suggest
  varying two of them.
- **:444, :515** — new stage action for Ward inside permitted new exchanges ("stops
  writing and looks… at the painted harbor"; "waits with the pen down"). Under the
  lead's connective-narration ruling these assert actions the novel does not contain,
  but they contradict nothing and Ward's follow-ups cannot be staged without something.
  Flagged once, for the record, not per instance.
- **:319** — `ward "Who went down with him?"` The outline marks this beat "fixed" with
  the novel's "Who came down in the lift?", but that line belongs to Sc10 and
  `e1_the_court.scenario:195` already uses it there, correctly. The reword is the right
  resolution of a conflict in the outline, not a defect. Recorded so it is not
  re-litigated.
- **:764–:769** — Nell's turn at the car requires `told_nell_in_the_court`, which only
  the both-facts answer sets. A Henry who had only one of the two facts gave Nell
  everything he had, and still gets no turn. The outline says the turn is for a Henry
  who "did exactly that" — told her what he saw and what he didn't — which arguably the
  partial answers also do. A ruling would be worth one line either way.

## `e1_coffee.scenario`

- **:46** — connective narration framing the five-place menu. Cleared by the lead's
  ruling: it describes the interface, not the world. Recorded as cleared.
- **:160** — `paul "Mr. Calder."` opens the permitted Paul-deflection block. Paul's cue
  count there is four, inside the outline's "four to six", and the pattern holds — he
  stops before the end of a sentence and looks for Ruth (`:164`, `:166`). Ruth's
  replacement line at `:178` is the one the outline asks for, and the novel's "You have
  no idea how much can be done with one syllable." is correctly kept on the other
  branch at `:148`. No defect; recorded so the count is on the record.

## `e1_table.scenario`

- **:658, :1137** — `paul` and `edwin` speak while not `show`n in their labels. Correct
  text and correct attribution; the consumer cannot highlight a speaker it is not
  drawing. One decision would settle both.

## `rooms/window/room.toml`

- **:273 / :287** — polish item, routed by the lead: the read narration ends "He does
  not pull it free." and the second interaction on the same hotspot then pulls it free.
  The design is right; the wording makes it read as a contradiction rather than a
  temptation. Suggest ending the read at "It is not a letter."
- **:210, :274** — pronoun repairs forced by splitting novel prose into hotspots
  ("Behind the empty seventh chair" for "Behind it"; "He does not" for "Henry does
  not"). Seen, judged, not defects.

## Cleared and closed

- **Escaped quotes at `e1_statements.scenario:696`.** Checked against the parser
  (`src/fx_games/components/scenario/parser.py:449–456`): `\"` decodes to a literal
  `"`, so Ruth's Sc13 speech renders exactly as the novel has it. The curly-quote sites
  at `e1_office.scenario:157` and `e1_table.scenario:1129` also match their novel
  sources, which use curly quotes in those two places. All three correct.
- **Character surnames.** Nell and June are **Avery**, not Ellery (cast bible :55,
  :191). An earlier in-flight version of `e1_statements` had "Nell Ellery" and "June
  Ellery"; the current file uses "Miss Avery" and "June Avery" throughout. Closed.
- **Glossary conflict on "That isn't what I asked."** Ruled by the lead, filed as R-01.
  The novel's form governs. The frozen snapshot was not edited.

---

# The Henry rule — findings

Checked every Henry cue in all six scenarios.

- Henry never says "I think", and never says "I believe", "must have", "probably" or
  "seems", on any path.
- Nothing Henry says in Ruth's hearing touches the gallery, the marks, the button or
  the stair. His three answers to Nell in the motor court
  (`e1_statements.scenario:775, 787, 797`) are the carton and the torn page only, which
  is what the outline permits verbatim, and Ruth is at the edge of the light for all of
  them.
- `e1_statements.scenario:297` — `henry "Somebody decided when."` in reply to Ward's
  "Then somebody else decided when he could go down." Henry drops Ward's "else". That
  is Henry declining an inference, not making one. Correct, and worth keeping.
- Henry is never below the Winter Room between 9:02 and 9:18: the descent is Paul and
  Ruth's, Henry watches the indicator, and the window room is entered only after
  Edwin's call.
- The hand in the door is not a choice (`e1_table.scenario:467–469`), and the only
  answer is "I don't know." (`e1_statements.scenario:199`).

# Facts audit

Every `set` and every room `set_flag`/`requires` uses an id from `FACTS.md`, **with the
single exception of `told_ruth_what_i_saw` (D5)**. Each scenario's `[[flags]]` block
matches the identifiers its own script touches, in both directions, for all six
scenarios. The case-level declaration errors are D7.

All six scenarios admit under `scenario check`: `e1_office` 8 states, `e1_way_in` 7,
`e1_coffee` 41, `e1_table` 42, `e1_the_court` 40727, `e1_statements` 4261.

# Still to do

- Re-check every defect above once the writers land fixes.
- Two browser play-throughs and screenshots, once the consumer lane has a run to point
  `/case/<tag>` at. Passes planned: one watching the Holts at every course and looking
  at little, one watching Ruth and Paul and looking at everything.

---

# Art audit — `out/the-grain-motor-court/assets/backdrop.png`

Checked against `chapter-01-one-person-there.fountain:296–308` (Scene 2's motor court),
against the narration the room itself reads out, and against
`rooms/window/room.toml`, which must draw the same window after the fall.

## Agrees with the novel

- The display windows are still illuminated; the court is dark. ✓
- The unfinished window is nearest the service door — the unmarked door is at the right
  edge and the unfinished window is immediately left of it. ✓
- Six mannequins face an empty seventh place: four standing, two seated on plinths, in
  a semicircle turned inward on an empty chair. Counted twice at 3× magnification. ✓
- The paper moon is **whole**, which is correct for the "before" plate. ✓
- A short black rectangle is left open above the moon, where the scenery meets the
  ceiling of the window. ✓
- A seamstress's chalk and a pair of scissors lie on the display floor inside the
  glass. ✓ Both objects are there, and they read as chalk and scissors.
- No people, no readable text, lettering, signage, branding or number plates anywhere
  in the image. ✓ Checked the street, the piers, the door and all five windows.
- 1972 in the cars, the street lamps and the fixtures; painted, gouache-like, warm
  amber against cold blue-black. ✓

## A1 — the other windows have no mannequins in them (defect)

The novel, and the room's own narration carried verbatim at
`rooms/motor_court/room.toml:135–137`:

> "The display windows are still illuminated. Inside them, mannequins attend dinners,
> descend painted staircases, and wait beside luggage that has never travelled."

The four other windows in the plate are **empty sets**: two laid tables, a painted
staircase, a stack of trunks, and not one figure in any of them. A player who clicks
"The other windows" reads about mannequins doing three things and is looking at a
picture with none.

The origin is the hotspot brief, not the generator — `room.toml:93` asks for "a laid
dinner, a painted staircase, a group of suitcases" and drops the mannequins the
sentence beside it promises. Fix the brief, then reroll.

## A2 — the seventh chair has no steel base (defect, and the worst of them)

`chapter-05-the-window.fountain:128`, which `rooms/window/room.toml:216` reads out
verbatim when the player looks at the man:

> "His body lies partly behind the chair, one shoulder against its **steel base**."

The chair drawn is a gilt wooden oval-back side chair standing on four slender turned
wooden legs. It has no base at all, steel or otherwise, and nothing a shoulder could
rest against.

This is the one that cannot be left, because the *after* plate has to be the same
chair. `rooms/window/room.toml:74` and `:111` both specify the steel base, so either
the before-plate is rerolled with a chair the novel's sentence can be true of, or the
window room narrates a chair the player can see is not there.

## A3 — the after-plate brief will not match the before-plate (continuity risk)

`chapter-05:124`: "Six mannequins **remain where Henry saw them on the way in**." And
`rooms/window/room.toml:25–29` makes recognising the frame the whole point of drawing
the after against the before.

| | before (delivered) | after (as briefed, `rooms/window/room.toml:71`) |
|---|---|---|
| dress | evening gowns | "in coats" |
| posture | four standing, two seated on plinths | "stand" — all six |

As written the two plates will disagree on both. The before-plate is the one that
exists, so the window room's brief should be amended to describe what was actually
drawn, not the other way round — rerolling the before-plate re-bills the room and the
plate is otherwise good.

## A4 — the moon is not paper (continuity risk)

The plate draws an astronomical moon, with visible craters and maria, lit from within.
The novel calls it "a white paper moon", and Scene 9 needs it to be paper:

> "the white paper moon has split and sagged inward" … "Paper moves slightly where the
> moon has torn."

A cratered lunar photograph cannot split and sag. Both plates depend on this reading as
a paper prop hung on a scenic wall. Worth a reroll of the window brief's wording at
minimum, so the after-plate does not inherit it.

## Hit areas, measured against the delivered plate

Pixel positions taken from the 1280×720 backdrop by luminance thresholding, then
confirmed visually with the regions drawn over the image.

| Hotspot | Object drawn at (norm) | Hotspot region | Overlap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service_bell` | x 0.852–0.863, y 0.471–0.508 | x 0.870–0.940, y 0.420–0.520 | **none** |
| `black_rectangle` | x 0.692–0.729, y 0.264–0.311 | x 0.635–0.755, y 0.235–0.290 | ~25% |
| `chalk_and_scissors` | x 0.693–0.724, y 0.653–0.682 | x 0.600–0.740, y 0.645–0.715 | contains |

- **`service_bell` has zero overlap with the bell, and it is the room's exit.** It sets
  `rang_the_bell`, the win flag, and it is the only way out of the room. The brass bell
  push is on the pier at px 1091–1105, 339–366; the hotspot is at px 1114–1203,
  302–374, entirely to the right of it on the blank door leaf. Clicking the bell does
  nothing. Clicking blank masonry rings it. Suggested region:
  `{ x = 0.840, y = 0.455, w = 0.040, h = 0.075 }`.
- **`black_rectangle`** sits high and wide, mostly on the window's top rail; only the
  object's top-left corner falls inside. Suggested:
  `{ x = 0.685, y = 0.257, w = 0.052, h = 0.055 }`.
- **`chalk_and_scissors`** does contain both objects, so it works. Most of its area is
  the masonry bulkhead below the glass. Tighten only if convenient:
  `{ x = 0.685, y = 0.648, w = 0.048, h = 0.045 }`.
- **`display_windows`** ends at px 691; the luggage window runs to about px 710 and
  `unfinished_window` starts at px 717, so the luggage window's right edge and its pier
  fall in a gap between the two. Minor.

`puzzle.validation.json` reports solvable, 16 reachable states, solution `[5]` — one
interaction, the bell. Correct as a graph; the graph does not know where the bell was
painted, which is why the hit areas had to be measured against the plate.

## Rights labelling on generated images

`out/the-grain-motor-court/room.json.meta.json` — the deterministic canonicalisation —
carries `rights.status = "unreviewed"`. The **generated image** does not:
`assets/backdrop.png.meta.json` has no `rights` key at all.

This is systemic rather than one file. Across every `out/the-grain-*` run, **21 of 21
provider-generated image sidecars carry no rights block** (nine cast plates, six cover
candidates, the room backdrop, the UI atlas pieces). The pilot brief's non-negotiable is
"Every generated image and track is labeled `unreviewed` in its rights fields", and the
director's semantic-review list is built from these runs.

The committed plate is correct — `references/cover.provenance.json` carries
`status: "unreviewed"`, a three-line basis and `publication_authorized: false`. So the
gap is confined to run artifacts under `out/`. Flagging for a ruling rather than as a
lane defect, since it may be a component-level omission rather than anything the art
lane did.

No absolute paths and no credentials appear anywhere under the run. ✓

# Art audit 2 — `out/the-grain-window/assets/backdrop.png` (hit areas and composition)

Audited for hit areas and composition only. Fidelity is not assessed: this plate was
generated against the old brief (coats, no steel base, cratered moon) and a reroll is
pending under the canonical window description.

## Hit areas — 9 of 14 hotspots do not cover the object they name

Regions from `out/the-grain-window/room.json`, object positions measured on the
delivered 1280×720 plate and confirmed against the regions drawn over the image.

| Hotspot | Verdict | Where the hotspot actually lands |
|---|---|---|
| `stage_door` | **miss** | blank stone wall between the vestibule and the window; the ajar door is at the right edge of the glass, roughly x 0.79–0.83 |
| `under_the_jaw` | **miss** | blank stone wall; the man's head is at roughly x 0.64–0.66, y 0.60–0.63 |
| `torn_piece` | **miss** | blank wall and floor; the right hand is at roughly x 0.79–0.80, y 0.66–0.67 |
| `painted_wall` | **miss** | stone wall left of the window; the scenic wall is inside the display, x 0.52–0.79 |
| `paper_moon` | **~6%** | on the gallery band above the window; the moon is at y 0.34–0.62, the box ends at y 0.36 |
| `six_figures` | **~5%** | the right jamb and the guard's booth; the six figures run x 0.52–0.79 |
| `mr_bell` | **miss** | wall to the guard's right; the guard stands at roughly x 0.26–0.33 |
| `steel_lip` | **miss** | upper-left soffit, left of the gallery |
| `wired_glass` | **miss** | above the pane; the pane sits lower in the door |
| `the_man` | hit | contains the body |
| `call_button` | hit | drawn at x 0.720–0.780, y 0.074–0.151 against a box of x 0.720–0.770, y 0.060–0.130 |
| `access_door` | hit | contains the flush door |
| `service_lift` | partial | contains the left-hand opening |
| `gallery_carton` | sprite | composited; position authored, not checkable from the backdrop |

**The consequences are not evenly spread.**

- **`stage_door` gates six other interactions** — `under_the_jaw`, `gallery_carton`,
  `steel_lip`, `painted_wall`, `call_button` and `torn_piece` all list it in
  `requires`. If it cannot be clicked, `touched_neck`, `carton_on_gallery`,
  `marks_under_lip`, `scrape`, `red_button`, `heading_int_bedroom` and
  `pulled_the_paper` are all unreachable — which is most of the board Ward's statement
  reads.
- **`mr_bell` gates its own chain of three**, so `bell_key_path`, `bell_in_receiving`
  and `court_door_never_opened` go with it.
- **`the_man` hits**, so `saw_body` is obtainable and the exit is reachable. The room is
  escapable. It is very nearly empty on the way through.

`puzzle.validation.json` reports solvable, 9312 reachable states, solution `[2, 17]`.
Correct as a graph, and again blind to where anything was painted.

## The diagnosis, which is the part worth keeping

The misses are not random. The hotspot map was authored against the brief's composition
— window centred, vestibule at the left — and the plate placed the window much further
right and much larger, and put the guard in the middle of the floor rather than a few
feet from the glass. Everything on the right of the map is therefore shifted left of
its object by roughly a fifth of the frame, and the few hotspots that hit are the ones
near the left edge and the one high on the gallery.

**Hotspot regions authored before the plate exists will not match it.** They are a
guess at a composition, and the generator is not bound by that guess. Every reroll
invalidates every region in the room, and the regions have to be re-measured against
the new pixels afterwards — a proof cannot do it, because the proof never sees the
image.

## Composition notes for the reroll

- The plate reads as an **interior** — a lobby with a coffered ceiling, recessed
  downlights and a polished floor. Scene 9 is outdoors: "Bell leads them through the
  service door and into the motor court. The night air is colder at street level. The
  lamps beneath the stone canopy shine into the display glass." There is no canopy, no
  wet paving, no street, no city. The court plate got this right and this one does not,
  and the two are supposed to be the same place.
- The guard stands roughly twenty feet from the glass, in the middle of the floor. The
  brief asks for "standing a few feet from the display glass", and Sc9 has "Bell stops
  several feet from the glass."
- The elements themselves are all present and legible: the lift and the wired-glass
  stair door at the left, the flush access door, the ajar stage door at the right of the
  glass, the guard's booth, the gallery with an open rail section, the red button, and
  the moon split across its middle. It is a good painting of the wrong room.

# Open items

## Waiting on other lanes

1. **Re-measure every hotspot in both rooms after the rerolls.** Fourteen in the window
   room, six in the court. `the_man` (exports `saw_body`, required by the window's exit)
   and `service_bell` (exports `rang_the_bell`, the court's win flag) get measured and
   reported first — a required hotspot that misses its object makes the room unplayable
   whatever the proof says.
2. **Two browser play-throughs**, once there is an `out/<tag>/case.json` and scene art:
   one watching the Holts at every course and looking at little, one watching Ruth and
   Paul and looking at everything. To report per pass: what the board held at the
   statement, what Ward said at his close, whether Nell turned back at the car.
   Screenshots of every movement and both rooms. The case shell itself is already
   confirmed working on `/case/demo` — breadcrumb, beat counter, backlog and
   Continue/Start over all render.

## One remaining minor, lowest priority

`rooms/window/room.toml:332` — "Edwin looks at the brass key in **his own** hand." The
novel (`chapter-05:272`) is "Edwin looks at the brass key in his hand." One word added
to lifted action prose. Unlike the pronoun repairs elsewhere in the room it is not
forced by the hotspot split, though it does disambiguate against Bell in the sentence
before. Leave or cut; noted only for completeness.

## Repository-level, for the director's report, not for a lane

21 of 21 provider-generated image sidecars under `out/the-grain-*` carry no `rights`
block, against the brief's requirement that every generated image is labelled
`unreviewed`. The committed package is compliant
(`references/cover.provenance.json`: `status: unreviewed`, three-line basis,
`publication_authorized: false`). Ruled by the lead as a gap the pilot surfaces and does
not fix, on the grounds that repairing a media-rights component mid-run in a shared tree
is how something breaks quietly.

---

# Expression / line audit (script half)

The lead asked whether the expression a character wears matches the line they are given
at that moment. That question has two halves. The **script half** — does the expression
*named* on a cue suit the line it carries — can be answered without any plates, and is
answered here. The **plate half** — does the drawn face match the name — waits on the
cast run and is an observation only; neither the lead nor QA may semantically review
what this run produced.

Method: every `actor expression "line"` and every `show actor expression at slot` across
all six scenarios, grouped by actor and expression, read against the cast bible's voice
notes. Thirty-two actor/expression pairs, 320 uses.

**No mismatches found.** The expression names are doing real work and are used where
they belong. The ones worth recording because they are load-bearing:

| Pair | Uses | Reads correctly because |
|---|---|---|
| `ruth/dry` | 18 | carries the epigrams — "I remembered you were a liar.", "At this hour?", "It's why you get paid." |
| `ruth/exposed` | 9 | carries the ones that cost her — "With needing you.", "She intends to forgive me.", "Henry.", "You watched the cup." |
| `ruth/shut` | 14 | carries the closures — "I remember what I said.", "Only to me.", "Not this one.", "No. Not tonight." |
| `ruth/composed` | 36 | and it is `composed`, not `exposed`, that carries "Watch my coffee." — correct, and the point of the scene |
| `marian/correcting` | 24 | every "You said…" line in the supper |
| `marian/nothing_to_correct` | 1 | used once, on "I suppose I did." — the one moment she has nothing to correct |
| `paul/stopped` | 9 | the stopping-mid-sentence tell — "It's from a page. It was in a—", "I don't know if I can.", "She tells it better." |
| `nell/gone` | 2 | "He has already had a long while." and the motor court |
| `ward/one_joke` | 1 | used once, on "Still in the same office?" — which is the joke |
| `ward/closed_notebook` | 4 | "Keep doing that.", "You are one of them.", "I can see it." — every line said after the notebook shuts |
| `edwin/no_keys` | 2 | shown only, never spoken, and only after his keys are taken in Sc10 |

Two pairs are visual-only and never carry a line: `robert/water` (one use, the glass he
brings Marian) and `robert/waiting` (three uses). That is legitimate — the art direction
authorises four expressions per actor — but `robert/water` costs a generated plate for a
single silent beat, which is worth knowing when the ledger is totalled.

`ward/blunt` carries "Was she frightened?" at two line numbers; those are the two paths
through the same beat, not a duplication.

## What remains for the plates

When the cast run lands, the only remaining question is whether each drawn plate reads
as the word it is named for. The map of which lines each plate must carry is at
`…/scratchpad/expression_lines.txt` — every actor/expression with its cues — so the
plate pass is a lookup rather than a re-derivation.

# Art audit 3 — motor court reroll (`out/the-grain-motor-court-2/`)

## Fidelity: all four defects fixed

- **A1** the other windows hold figures — one seated at a laid dinner table, one on the
  painted staircase, one standing beside the trunks. The room's own verbatim narration
  is drawn at last.
- **A2** the seventh chair is a pedestal chair on a single slender steel column base, so
  "one shoulder against its steel base" is a sentence about something that exists.
- **A3** six figures in evening dress, four standing and two seated on plinths — the
  canonical description, and what the window room must now match.
- **A4** the moon is flat matte paper, no craters and no lunar surface.

Black rectangle open above the moon, chalk and scissors on the display floor, no
readable text anywhere, no people.

## Hit areas: three of six need correcting

Measured by largest-connected-blob detection with a hand-checked threshold, then
confirmed by drawing each proposed rectangle back onto the plate and looking at it.

| Hotspot | Object drawn at (px) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `service_bell` | x 1119–1132, y 354–372 | **half-covered** — region 1075–1126 catches the bell's left 7px and spends the rest on blank pier |
| `black_rectangle` | x 864–913, y 187–219 | region 877–943 catches the right two-thirds, overruns onto plain wall |
| `chalk_and_scissors` | chalk x 859–869 y 459–464; scissors x 902–932 y 462–477 | **misses both** — region sits mostly on the masonry bulkhead below the glass and contains neither the chalk nor most of the scissors |
| `stone_canopy` | — | correct |
| `display_windows` | — | correct |
| `unfinished_window` | — | correct |

### Corrected regions

```toml
service_bell        = { x = 0.857, y = 0.461, w = 0.045, h = 0.086 }
black_rectangle     = { x = 0.666, y = 0.243, w = 0.057, h = 0.078 }
chalk_and_scissors  = { x = 0.660, y = 0.617, w = 0.079, h = 0.065 }
```

The bell is a 13×18px object. The corrected region gives a 58×62px target, which is a
comfortable size for the room's only exit rather than a pixel hunt — the old region and
the drawn bell were 40px apart, close enough to be clickable and far enough to be
missed.

## Method note

Simple luminance thresholding is not reliable here: it repeatedly clipped on the
search-window edge and returned the box it had been asked to look inside. Object
positions in this audit come from largest-connected-blob detection, and every proposed
rectangle is drawn back onto the plate and inspected before it is reported. The window
room's fourteen hotspots get the same treatment.

Tooling: `…/scratchpad/hotspots.py <run-dir>` renders the overlay, cuts one padded crop
per hotspot, and derives the gating structure from `room.json` — it colours a region
differently when its flag is required by the exit, so the load-bearing ones are
separated before anything is judged by eye.

---

# Art audit 4 — the convergence question (`motor-court-2` → `motor-court-3`)

The lead applied three corrected rectangles and nothing else, and the backdrop redrew
because `room-resolve` sits upstream of the image node and a rectangle invalidates it by
lineage. The question was whether hit areas can ever converge under that.

**They do, provided they are padded.** All three rectangles still cover their objects on
the new plate.

| Object | plate-2 centre | plate-3 centre | moved | my region still covers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bell push | (1125.5, 363) | (1111.5, 383) | 24px | 82% |
| black rectangle | (888.5, 203) | (907.5, 226.5) | 30px | 82% x, 67% y |
| chalk + scissors | (895.5, 467.5) | (909, 490) | 26px | chalk fully, scissors 57% |

Mean displacement 27px on a 1280×720 frame — 2.1% of width, 3.7% of height. All three
moved down and two of three moved right: a coherent global drift, not independent
scatter, which is why one padded region absorbs it.

It held because the regions were padded. The bell is a 13×18px object and was given a
58×62px target, chosen for playability rather than for drift tolerance, and that is what
absorbed the movement. A region fitted tightly to its object would have missed all three.

## The rule that survives measurement

> Brief **unchanged**, regions changed → the composition drifts about 27px. Padded
> regions survive; one correction pass converges.
>
> Brief **changed** → the composition is re-imagined, not nudged. Between the first and
> second motor-court rolls the window moved by roughly a fifth of the frame, and between
> `window-2` and `window-3` every one of fourteen measurements was invalidated.

So the recommendation is *generate, measure, correct, re-run, verify* — padding every
region by at least 2.5% of frame width beyond the object's own bounds (~30px at
1280×720), because the correction re-bills the backdrop and the redraw moves things by
about that much. The verify step usually passes; it is not optional, because nothing
guarantees it.

**Caveat, and it belongs beside the number: this is n=1.** One reroll pair, three
objects. Image generation's noise floor is large and a single A/B measures sampling
noise as much as effect. The qualitative claim — same brief nudges, changed brief
re-imagines — now has three observations behind it and is what should be defended.
"27px" is an observation, not an estimate.

The contract finding stands regardless: the backdrop should not be invalidated by a
rectangle. Fixing that lineage would make regions converge exactly rather than
probabilistically, and drop the cost of a correction from one operation to zero.

---

# Art audit 5 — `out/the-grain-window-3/`

## Fidelity

- **The chair is fixed.** A pedestal chair on a single slender steel column base with a
  circular foot. "One shoulder against its steel base" is now true of the object. The
  hardened brief worked where the soft one did not.
- **The moon is right.** Flat matte paper, no craters, split clean across the middle
  with the lower half sagging inward.
- **Minor divergence:** the man lies *in front of* the chair rather than partly behind
  it, and his shoulder is about 30px clear of the column. The novel is "His body lies
  partly behind the chair, one shoulder against its steel base." Closer than any
  previous roll; recorded rather than re-billed.

## Hit areas: both required hotspots work

`the_man` hits — the body spans y 413–480 and the region starts at 446, so about 60% of
it including both shoes is live. `saw_body` is obtainable, `left_the_room` is reachable,
the case can be completed. `stage_door` is a clean hit, so its six dependents are all
reachable once their own rectangles are fixed.

*A note against myself:* at contact-sheet size `the_man` looked like a miss and a
run-stopping message was half-written. At full size the legs and shoes are plainly
inside. **A claim that a room cannot be finished has to be checked at full resolution
before it is sent.**

### Corrected regions

```toml
the_man        = { x = 0.602, y = 0.553, w = 0.141, h = 0.135 }
under_the_jaw  = { x = 0.645, y = 0.553, w = 0.047, h = 0.081 }
torn_piece     = { x = 0.605, y = 0.589, w = 0.041, h = 0.065 }
paper_moon     = { x = 0.616, y = 0.331, w = 0.155, h = 0.242 }
six_figures    = { x = 0.492, y = 0.344, w = 0.109, h = 0.322 }
call_button    = { x = 0.691, y = 0.097, w = 0.039, h = 0.083 }
steel_lip      = { x = 0.547, y = 0.178, w = 0.141, h = 0.047 }
gallery_carton = { x = 0.658, y = 0.114, w = 0.052, h = 0.078 }
mr_bell        = { x = 0.305, y = 0.424, w = 0.066, h = 0.389 }
```

`stage_door`, `access_door` and `service_lift` land correctly and are left alone.

**`six_figures` is deliberately narrow.** A box spanning all six figures (x 640–1050)
would also cover the moon, the chair, the man and the paper — and `six_figures` is first
in the interaction list, so it would swallow every click meant for any of them. It is
placed on the two left-hand standing figures instead. That is a hit-area decision with a
story cost: clicking the figures on the right of the window gets the moon or the body.

## Two unresolved, needing an art decision rather than a measurement

1. **`wired_glass`** exports `whiting_on_treads`, and the one wired-glass pane in the
   picture is in the *stage door* (x 320–370, y 330–380), not in the DISPLAY ACCESS door
   where the room document puts it and where the stair with the whiting is supposed to
   show. No rectangle proposed. Either the brief separates the two doors more sharply,
   or the hotspot moves to the pane that exists and the narration follows it.
2. **`painted_wall`** exports `scrape`, and no long scrape is drawn anywhere on the
   scenic wall — which is in any case almost entirely occluded by the figures and the
   moon. No rectangle proposed. The outline names the scrape as one of the two facts
   step 6a of the argument needs, so letting `scrape` go unobtainable is a decision to
   record, not a thing to let happen quietly.

---

# Art audit 6 — `out/the-grain-window-4/` verify, and a correction to audit 4

The twelve corrected rectangles are present in `window-4/room.json`, matching what was
sent; `stage_door` and `service_lift` were left unchanged as agreed.

**The drift rule did not hold.** This was a regions-only edit, and the composition was
re-imagined rather than nudged.

| | motor court | window room |
|---|---|---|
| rectangles changed | 3 | 12 |
| result | drifted ~27px | re-imagined |
| rectangles that survived | 3 of 3 | 7 of 14 |

### What misses on window-4

- **`service_lift`, the exit** — the region sits on an open view of the wet night street
  with a lamp and trees. The lift door, with its diamond wired-glass panel, is at
  px 160–233; the region's right edge is 154. A clean miss by 6px.
- **`stage_door`, which gates six** — the region is on a blank stone pier. The two doors
  in the picture are at px ~217–289, to its left.
- `under_the_jaw`, `torn_piece`, `call_button`, `painted_wall`, `gallery_carton` — all
  drifted off their objects.

Still hitting: `the_man` (exports `saw_body`, required by the exit), `paper_moon`,
`six_figures`, `mr_bell`, `access_door`, and `steel_lip` / `wired_glass` marginally.

### The room is not blocked, and the distinction matters

A hotspot is a rectangle over the image; a click inside it fires whatever it is bound to
regardless of what is painted underneath. `the_man` hits, so `saw_body` is obtainable
and the exit is reachable by clicking the empty street. **Every fact in the room remains
obtainable.** What is broken is the correspondence between what the player sees and what
they can click: leaving means clicking a street, opening the stage door means clicking
blank stone, and the lift door they can actually see fires `access_door`, which now sits
on top of it. Unplayable-feeling rather than unplayable.

### The corrected finding

Audit 4's rule was stated from one measurement and is wrong as stated. The honest form:

> A same-brief redraw sometimes nudges and sometimes re-imagines. One correction pass
> **may** converge; it is not reliable, and on this evidence the larger the edit the less
> reliable it is. Nothing in the contract makes it converge.

n=2 with a disagreement is weaker than n=1 with a clean result, and considerably more
honest. Measuring twice is what revealed it; the first measurement alone would have
supported a rule that is not true. This is the second time in this run that a single
image-generation observation proved to be sampling noise dressed as a finding.

The contract finding is unchanged and is now the whole answer rather than half of it:
**the backdrop should not be invalidated by a rectangle.** Fix that lineage and regions
converge trivially, because the picture stops moving. Until then, hit areas in
`pointclick-room-v2` are approximate by construction. If the image adapter exposes a
seed, pinning it would make a regions-only re-run reproduce the same picture and let
rectangles land exactly — that is the concrete fix, even if it is not for today.

# Play notes — pass 1 (the Holts, looking at nothing), partial

Played at `http://localhost:3000/case/the-grain-episode-one` against
`the-grain-scene-4`, `the-grain-motor-court-3`, `the-grain-window-3`.
Reached beat 4 of 8 (`b_table`, statement `arrivals_sit_down#18`) before pausing.

## The board, quoted from the save rather than inferred

The shell's `localStorage` save exposes `beat_id`, `statement_id`, the full fact list,
flags, stage, and the actor/slot/expression array — so boards in these notes are read
from state, not eyeballed.

After the motor court and the way in, a Henry who looked at nothing carries exactly:

```
place_card_moved_twice, rang_the_bell, suitcase_unopened
```

Three facts: the two the scene hands over and the exit flag. No looks. Correct.

## Verified in play

- **The fixed sentence lands.** "I remembered you were a liar." arrives from Ruth's
  mouth, in the oxblood dress and camel coat, at line 6 of 95.
- **The case chains.** Beat 1 ends on an outcome card reading "Tolland's, eight o'clock"
  — the `to_tollands` ending label — with a Continue that moves to beat 2 of 8.
- **Resume works across a reload.** Reloading into a fresh tab mid-episode offered
  "A save is waiting at The table", and Continue landed correctly. This is gate item 8's
  reload clause and it passes.
- **The motor court's corrected hotspots are right in the build.** The Hotspots overlay
  shows all six landing on their objects. The bell rang on one tap and returned both
  novel sentences verbatim: "Ruth presses a bell beside an unmarked service door. Each
  footstep returns from the stone."
- **Every line checked against the script matched**, text and speaker, at lines 5, 17,
  24, 48, 72, 77 of the office and 4, 30, 36, 40, 42, 92, 134 of the table.

## Composition — the lead's first question

**Five slots are legible.** With marian `far_left`, ruth `left`, robert `center`, lydia
`right`, nell `far_right` all up, the far ranks are visibly smaller, dimmer and set back.
The treatment is real; it is simply invisible with only three actors, because `far_left`
and `left` are adjacent steps on the ramp.

**The speaker highlight reads without the name plate.** The speaker is brightened,
brought forward and slightly enlarged while the others recede. Confirmed deliberately by
catching Marian in consecutive frames, once speaking and once not.

**But the room disappears behind the cast.** At five, the Winter Room is a strip of glass
dome above their heads and one corner of the round table between Ruth and Robert. The
table laid for eight — the shape the movement keeps discussing ceasing to be — is not
visible. It reads as five people standing in a row, not a supper. Two causes, both
independent of the slot design: the plates are full-body standing figures, and they are
composited large enough that heads touch the top of the stage and feet are cut off by the
dialogue panel. Reducing the composite scale would restore the room at no cost to
legibility, because the highlight is doing the work of directing the eye.

A related oddity that follows from the sprite convention: everyone stands, throughout a
seated supper for eight.

## Expression — the lead's second question

**They land at play scale.** Ruth's `shut` is unmistakable on "That's what makes it
unpleasant." — eyes lowered, head turned away — and clearly different from the `composed`
plate two lines earlier. Compared at full plate size, `exposed` and `shut` share coat,
dress, hair and framing and differ only in face and carriage, so the character does not
jump between lines.

## Defect — every beat transition is a black screen

3–6 seconds of pure black on each beat change, with no spinner and no title card: the
breadcrumb updates and the stage stays black until the art decodes. About 2s into the
office; over 5s into the supper, which loads a stage plus five 1024×1536 plates. It reads
as a hang. A loading state is the cheapest polish available in the build.

## Blocked

Pass 1 paused at beat 4 pending a decision on the medium (below), since the remaining
beats would be played against art that may be replaced.

# Art audit 7 — the episode is in two media

The six scenario beats are **photorealistic photography**. The two rooms, and
`references/cover.png` which is supposed to govern every image, are **painted gouache**.

Root cause, one field:

```
out/the-grain-scene-4/style-anchor.json
  "style_mode": "photorealistic_natural"
  "medium_keyword": "photorealistic natural photography"
```

The brief's art direction is the opposite and explicit: "painted illustration,
gouache-like, visible brushwork, restrained detail. **Not photoreal**, not anime, not
comic ink. Nothing glossy."

It is not a reference-binding failure. `request.json` binds `style_reference_id "cover"`
to `references/cover.png` with the correct sha256 — the painted plate is attached. The
anchor's medium keyword simply wins over the reference image.

**Why the rooms escaped it:** each `room.toml` carries an authored `[style]` block —
label "painted illustration, gouache-like, 1972 Los Angeles at night", with an `avoid`
list whose first entry is "photorealism". The scenario contract has no `[style]` block at
all: it gives a scenario cast, stages, tracks and endings, and no way to state its
medium. So the recipe defaulted, and the default is photoreal. **The rooms could say it
and the scenarios could not.** That is the contract gap, and it is the finding rather
than the individual plates.

In play, a player walks out of a photograph into a painting and back again, twice, and
the cover the director opens the report with is the painting.

# The window room: which roll ships, and what a player will actually find

The lead reverted `b_window` to `the-grain-window-3` rather than ship `window-4`. Having
measured both, I agree, and the reasoning is worth stating precisely because a raw count
of misses is misleading.

**A region that misses its object is still clickable.** The rectangle does not care what
is painted under it. So on both rolls every fact in the room remains obtainable; the
miss count is not a count of lost facts, it is a count of places where the player must
click something they cannot see. What separates the rolls is *which* interactions are
the invisible ones.

| | `window-3` (shipped) | `window-4` |
|---|---|---|
| the exit (`service_lift`) | lands on the lift | lands on an empty street |
| `stage_door` (gates six) | lands on the door | lands on a blank pier |
| the visible lift door | is the lift | fires `access_door` instead |
| misses | 9 of 14 | 7 of 14 |

A player on `window-3` can find the room's spine — kneel by the body, open the stage
door, question Bell, leave by the lift — and will miss detail. A player on `window-4`
cannot find the way in or the way out, and the one door they can see lies to them.

## What a real player's board will hold

On the shipped roll the interactions that land on their objects are the body, the stage
door, Mr. Bell's three answers, the access door and the lift. The ones sitting on blank
wall are the neck, the torn paper, the carton, the marks under the lip, the scrape, the
red button, the moon and the wired glass.

So a played board out of this room will plausibly hold `saw_body`, `stage_door_locked`,
`access_door_unlocked`, `bell_key_path`, `bell_in_receiving` and
`court_door_never_opened`, and plausibly **not** hold `touched_neck`,
`heading_int_bedroom`, `carton_on_gallery`, `marks_under_lip`, `scrape`, `red_button`,
`window_changed` or `whiting_on_treads`.

That is most of the forensic half of the board — the part Ward's statement is built to
read. The episode still plays to its end and Ward still closes, but on a thin forensic
board **because of a hit-area artifact, not because the player chose not to look.** That
distinction is the one the director needs; the miss count is not.

## The lineage defect, in its most concrete form

There is no way to ship `window-3`'s plate with `window-4`'s rectangles, because
applying the rectangles is what produced `window-4`. Stated plainly:

> We measured the right numbers for a picture, and writing them down destroyed the
> picture.

The two concrete fixes remain: derive the backdrop's cache identity from the fields that
feed the image rather than from the whole document, and pin the image seed so a
regions-only re-run reproduces the same picture.

# Play plan for the two passes, with predictions stated in advance

The complete choice map was extracted from the scripts before playing: 22 menus across
the three branching scenarios (5 in `e1_table`, 6 in `e1_coffee`, 11 in `e1_statements`)
with their gating conditions, plus both rooms' interaction order and `requires` chains.
Predictions are recorded here **before** the passes run, so each pass is a test rather
than a description. If a board comes out otherwise, that is a defect named in advance
rather than rationalised afterwards.

## Pass 1 — the Holts, looking at almost nothing

| Beat | Choices |
|---|---|
| motor court | the bell only |
| table | Watch Nell · Watch the Holts · Let him work at it · Watch Lydia say it · Follow the tin |
| coffee | Go where the place cards are · Watch her face · Turn to Marian · Keep your eyes on the room · Let her come |
| window | the man, then the lift |
| statements | I couldn't say · Leave the letter · He had it at the table · I don't think so · She said he was downstairs with the carton · Ward told us not to compare statements · Let her finish · I'm not going to describe it to you |

**Predicted:** `ward_close_plain`; `ward_regard` **not** set; Nell does not turn at the car.

## Pass 2 — Ruth and Paul, looking at everything

| Beat | Choices |
|---|---|
| motor court | all four looks |
| table | Read the place cards yourself · Watch Ruth and Paul · Offer the pocketknife · Watch Ruth · Watch Edwin's round |
| coffee | the service bar · Ask him anyway · Watch his coat · Watch the floor indicator · Look at the indicator · all three of Ruth's return looks |
| window | everything, including pulling the paper free |
| statements | Her reaction said no · tell him the sentence · tell him the letter · Mr. Price laid it beside his fork · She didn't drink the coffee · both accounts · dust on her shoe · That you didn't drink your coffee · He said he needed time · the carton and the page |

**Predicted:** `ward_close_kept_looking`; `ward_regard` set; Nell turns.

## A note on method, and a mistake worth recording

The first attempt at pass 1 was discarded. Bulk-advancing by dispatching synthetic clicks
at CSS coordinates put the click inside the menu plates, so the harness silently chose a
strand — `ruth_roll` appeared in the ledger where `marian_salt` was intended. It was
caught by reading the fact list, not by looking at the screen.

That is the characteristic failure of driving a canvas game from outside: **the harness
cannot see what it clicked, so the only check that works is reading the resulting board.**
Both passes therefore quote every board from the `localStorage` save — which exposes
`beat_id`, `statement_id`, case facts, per-beat flags, and the room's `fired` / `flags` /
`solved` — rather than from screenshots.

# Art audit 8 — `out/the-grain-scene-5/`, the medium fix verified

The scene graph was re-run against a corrected style anchor:

```
style_mode  gouache_illustration_2d
medium      editorial gouache illustration
traits      opaque matte paint shapes · visible dry-brush texture ·
            simplified graphic silhouettes · restrained paper grain
```

**Root cause, traced by the lead to the last inch and worth recording in full**, because
it locates the contract gap rather than the field: the anchor is chosen by a structured
call whose entire input is `style_selection_brief` — the `scene_brief` plus each actor's
appearance and invariants, and nothing else. The `scene_brief` was eighty-two characters
describing an *event* with no visual content ("A farewell supper in a closed 1972
department store, and a man found in its window"). The model was asked to choose a
medium from a plot summary and reasonably chose photography. The rooms escaped only
because `room.toml` carries an authored `[style]` block. **The scenario package has no
place to state its medium, so the medium is inferred from whatever prose is nearest.**
The durable fix is a style block on the scenario contract; the fix taken today was to put
the medium in the brief's first clause.

## Verified

- **Stages.** `scene-5`'s office stage against `references/cover.png`, with `scene-4`'s
  as the control: scene-4 is photographic (optical depth of field, real leather
  highlights, real light through venetian blinds); scene-5 is painted (matte opaque
  shapes, visible brushwork, simplified silhouettes). scene-5 sits with the cover. The
  warmer ochre against the cover's blue-black is correct — a late-afternoon interior
  against a night exterior.
- **Cast.** `ruth-exposed` across both runs plus `ruth-shut`: scene-4 is photography;
  scene-5 has visible brushwork on the coat, matte skin and painted modelling. Wardrobe
  holds across the change, and the expression distinction survives.
- **Admission.** All six scenarios admit in the run's own validation output, with the
  same state counts as the CLI. `e1_statements` imports eleven flags including
  `indicator_at_three` and `ruth_two_fingers` — the two unpaid looks are wired in — and
  all three of Ward's closes and both of Nell's car branches are in the reachable-label
  set, so the outcomes the two passes predict are provably reachable before they are
  attempted.

## The residual gap, recorded and not re-billed

The cast plates are **painterly realism rather than the flat graphic gouache of the
cover**. The cover's figures are simplified into opaque shapes; Ruth is a realistic
portrait that happens to be painted. Against the rooms and the stages the episode now
reads as one world, which is what was broken and is now fixed. Against the cover
specifically there is still a step. The lever, if it is ever revisited, is the sprite
treatment line in the anchor — "isolated painted character sprite with a readable
silhouette" asks for less than the background line, which demands "distinct depth planes"
and got them.

# Play notes — PASS 1 (the Holts, looking at almost nothing) — COMPLETE

Played end to end on `the-grain-scene-5`, `the-grain-motor-court-3`,
`the-grain-window-3`, at `/case/the-grain-episode-one`. Ended: **"The case is closed. It
ended through `left_alone`."**

Every board below is quoted from the `localStorage` save at that beat, not eyeballed.

## The board at the statement — seventeen facts

| | |
|---|---|
| carried in | `place_card_moved_twice`, `rang_the_bell`, `suitcase_unopened`, `hand_in_the_door`, `would_you_have_come_first`, `marian_salt`, `envelope_hear_it`, `saucers_crossed_out`, `key_returned_to_edwin`, `paul_not_to_wait`, `paul_needed_to_think`, `saw_body`, `left_the_room` |
| said to Ward | `kept_reaction`, `kept_key_origin`, `kept_frightened`, `kept_paul_words` |

Not held: `eighth_card`, `ruth_knife_on_plate`, `brass_key_after_dessert`,
`pocketknife_lent`, `coffee_not_drunk`, `smear_on_shoe`, `indicator_at_three`,
`ruth_two_fingers`, and everything in the window beyond the body.

## Predictions — all three confirmed

| | predicted | observed |
|---|---|---|
| Ward's close | `ward_close_plain`, no `ward_regard` | correct |
| Nell at the car | does not turn | correct — `told_nell_in_the_court` unset → `nell_does_not_turn` |
| the ending | `left_alone` | correct |

## The gating works, and it is the best thing in the build

Verified in play at every beat of the statement:

- **Ruth and the card** — two options only. *"Her reaction said no."* is **absent**. A
  Henry who did not read the cards cannot make the claim.
- **The key** — one option, "He had it at the table."
- **Her return** — routed to `return_ward_asks`, not `return_ward_knows`. *"She didn't
  drink the coffee."* is never offered.
- **June's sentence** — the whole beat is skipped; Ward never asks, because nobody told
  him there is a sentence.
- **Nell in the court** — one option, "I'm not going to describe it to you."
- **What Paul said** — all three offered, correctly, because both accounts are
  unmissable. What Henry gives is a real choice rather than a capability.

**A player cannot lie upward.** The episode's promise — what he watched he saw, and what
he saw he can later say — is enforced by the script, visibly, at every beat.

## Defect — the board is destroyed at the ending

On reaching `left_alone` the shell clears the save. `Object.keys(localStorage)` returns
`[]`. The entire board — seventeen facts, `ward_regard`, what he told Ruth, what he said
to Nell — is discarded at the exact moment it becomes the episode's output.

`FACTS.md` says *"What Henry carries into Episode Two: the board, exactly"*, and the
outline's final section is built on it. **As shipped, nothing carries.** The episode
computes its verdict and throws it away; no player, director, or Episode Two can read
what a play-through produced. Pass 1's board exists only because state was sampled at
every beat while playing.

Small fix if it is ever taken: write the final state under a completed-run key instead of
deleting it, so the ending leaves an artifact.

## Two smaller findings

- **The room narration panel overflows.** On the window room's exit the exit narration
  and the win narration concatenate to three lines, and the third renders *below* the
  panel border on the dark background. A length problem, not a layout one — it appears
  only where two narrations join.
- **One-option menus** ("He had it at the table.", "I'm not going to describe it to
  you.") are presented identically to real choices. Correct behaviour, slightly odd
  feel. Not worth fixing.

## Confirmed in passing

- The loading label clears on **room** leaves as well as scenario leaves
  (`data-shell-loading` count 0 in the window room), so both leaf kinds are covered.
- **Gouache changes the composition verdict.** At five slots the painted figures
  integrate with the painted room instead of sitting on it. The Winter Room is still
  largely behind them, but it reads as a painted group in a painted room rather than
  cutouts on a backdrop. The scale note stands, and is softer than it was against the
  photoreal art.

# Play notes — PASS 2 (Ruth and Paul, looking at everything) — COMPLETE

Played end to end on `the-grain-scene-5`, `the-grain-motor-court-3`,
`the-grain-window-3`. Ended: **"The case is closed. It ended through `left_alone`."**

## The board — 54 facts, read from the result record

```
fx_games.case_result.the-grain-episode-one
  run_tag      the-grain-episode-one
  outcome      left_alone
  finished_at  2026-09-02T23:05:36.522Z
  facts        54, sorted
```

42 carried into the statement, 12 written by it. Every fact sampled during the pass
appears in the record; the only one in the record not in a sample is
`would_you_have_come_second`, set in the motor court after the last sample. Correct.

Against pass 1's **seventeen**.

## Predictions — all three confirmed

| | predicted | observed |
|---|---|---|
| Ward's close | `ward_close_kept_looking` | correct — reached `told_coffee` **and** `told_shoe` **and** `told_paul_words` |
| `ward_regard` | set | correct |
| Nell at the car | turns | correct — `told_nell_in_the_court` set → `nell_turns` |

## The gating, verified in both directions

The two passes together are the proof. Same script, same build, opposite ends:

| Beat | pass 1 — looked at nothing | pass 2 — looked at everything |
|---|---|---|
| Ruth and the card | 2 options, report **absent** | 3 options, report present |
| June's sentence | beat **skipped entirely** | beat runs; Henry offers it |
| The key | 1 option, "He had it at the table." | 2, including "Mr. Price laid it beside his fork" |
| Her return | `return_ward_asks`, no report | `return_ward_knows`, report offered |
| Nell in the court | 1 option, "I'm not going to describe it to you." | 4, including both objects |
| Ward's close | `ward_close_plain`, no `ward_regard` | `ward_close_kept_looking`, `ward_regard` |
| Nell at the car | does not turn | turns |

**A player cannot lie upward, and cannot be denied what they earned.**

## Both fixes verified

- **Case result record.** Exists after `left_alone` with the right shape and facts; the
  in-progress save is correctly gone and the record is the only remaining key. The
  closing card — "CARRIED OUT OF THE BUILDING · 54" over twelve wrapped lines of small
  caps — is legible at that length, does not overflow, and does not crowd the button.
- **Narration overflow.** Checked on the exact case that broke it, the window room's
  exit where the exit and win narrations concatenate. Three lines, inside the border, at
  a smaller size that reads as a longer passage rather than a different component.

## Two moments confirmed in play

The model exchange plays as written — Ward *"That isn't what I asked."* then Henry
*"It is what I saw."* at line 99/272 — and Henry's *"I will."* closes Ward's earned door
line. Both fixed sentences landed verbatim on screen, not only in the file.

## What pass 2 proves about the shipped window room

All fifteen interactions fired and all sixteen window flags were collected, including
`pulled_the_paper` — **but only because the clicks were aimed at measured rectangles
rather than at the objects in the picture.** `under_the_jaw` and `torn_piece` could not
be hit by aiming at the body; the Hotspots overlay was needed to find them.

That is the shipped hit-area gap seen from the player's side, and it confirms the
prediction in the window-3 note: a determined player with an overlay can get everything;
a normal player will not find the neck or the paper.

## Observation

Beat loads degraded from 2–8s in pass 1 to 20–30s in pass 2 on the same build and
assets, with page memory flat at 35MB. Most likely dev-server recompilation after the
morning's commits rather than anything in the game. Recorded as an observation; nobody
plays this on a dev server.
