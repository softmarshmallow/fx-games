"""The `case-v1` authored contract: the container above the narrative leaves.

A scenario is one movement and a room is one screen. Neither knows what follows
it, and until now nothing did: a game that wanted six scenarios and two rooms
played in sequence had to chain them in a consumer, which put story structure in
a place no proof could see.

A **case** is that structure, authored and provable. It is an ordered graph of
**beats** - each beat naming a leaf member and the kind of leaf it is - joined by
**edges keyed on outcomes**: a scenario beat leaves through the `end <outcome>`
the player reached, a room beat leaves when its win condition is met. It declares
a **fact** namespace, and facts are the only thing that crosses a beat boundary.
No inventory crosses; a room's items are that room's.

Two things this deliberately is *not*.

It is **not a second scenario**. A case has no lines, no staging, no conditions
and no choices. Everything a player reads happens inside a leaf, and a leaf's own
proof is untouched by the case - `scenario check` and `prove_room_solvable` still
run per leaf, exactly as they did.

It is **not a state machine over facts**. The case proof never enumerates fact
assignments, because that is the state-space explosion the leaf ceiling already
guards against and doing it twice would buy nothing. It runs a must-availability
dataflow over the beat graph instead, which is linear in beats and edges: see
`proof.py`.

See `docs/spec/game/case.md`.
