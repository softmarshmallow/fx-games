"""Read one authored case offline, prove it, refuse it, then hand it on.

The order is the scenario resolver's order and for the same reason: parse, prove,
and only then let anything downstream build on it. A case that cannot be finished
costs nothing to refuse and is expensive to discover in play.

This module resolves the case's own structure and nothing below it. Binding the
beats to the leaves they name - resolving each scenario and each room, and
checking the beat's declared reads and writes against what the leaf actually does
- lives in `the_grain_pipeline.case_binding`, because a component may not
import a recipe and a room is a recipe.
