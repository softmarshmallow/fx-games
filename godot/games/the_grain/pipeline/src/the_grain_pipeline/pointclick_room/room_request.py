"""Resolve one authored point-and-click room package: read, digest, prove.

A room is a package directory, not a lone document: ``room.toml`` beside the
``references/`` the art is generated against. Everything the plan needs is
materialized here, touching no provider — the reference bytes are read and
matched against the digests the author recorded, and the solvability proof is
part of admission, so no art is ever paid for against a broken puzzle or a
reference that silently changed.
