"""The point-and-click room contract: an authored text IR for one puzzle room.

A room is a composition document, not code: the author declares the scene, the
hotspots, the items, and the interaction graph, and the system supplies the
vocabulary — verbs, effects, and the deterministic machinery that proves the
room can be finished before anything is generated or played. Generation fills
in art and narration only; puzzle logic never comes from a model.

This is the recipe's whole gameplay vocabulary on purpose. A verb or effect a
room cannot express here is a system change, landed at this declared taxonomy
path (``2d/roomview/pointclick``), never smuggled in through prompt text.
