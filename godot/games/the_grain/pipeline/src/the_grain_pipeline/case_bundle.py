"""Publish one proven case as `case.json`, the runtime projection a consumer plays.

The authored case names its leaves by package `member`; a consumer plays **runs**.
Nothing joined the two, because nothing could: a run tag does not exist until its
leaf has been generated, so the join cannot be authored beside the case and cannot
be derived from it either. It is supplied here, once, at publication.

The document is the authored case verbatim with one field added per beat, and it
carries its own identity - `case-runtime-v1` - because a beat that has grown a run
tag is a different document from the one the author wrote. Every other recipe in
this repository publishes its runtime manifest beside its authored contract the
same way.

Nothing is generated and no provider is reached. The case is proven and its leaves
are bound first, so a case that cannot be played is refused here rather than
discovered by a player.
