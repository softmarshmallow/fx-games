"""Resolve one authored scene package into everything the plan is built from.

Planning must be able to state the whole graph - and refuse a bad package - without
reaching a provider. Every digest a node's cache key needs is settled here: the
canonical scene document, the policy, the prompt templates, the transparency
derivation, the packaged style resources, the authored character profile, and the
authored reference images the scene is drawn against.

A scene binds several scenarios. Everything the graph fans out over - stages,
drawable cast, tracks - is the **union** across them, computed here, so the same
room, actor or track named by three scenarios resolves to one entry and is drawn
once. Two scenarios that name one id with different content are refused rather
than silently reconciled: which of the two briefs the one backdrop should be
drawn from is not a question the pipeline may answer for the author.

A scene is a directory, not a loose request file. Every member it names is read from
inside that directory, confined to it, following no symlink, and matched against the
digest the author recorded.
