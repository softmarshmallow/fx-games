"""The runner's gameplay contract: named profiles, no authored numbers.

An infinite runner's feel is a handful of closed names - how it runs, how it
jumps, how wide it collides, what each way of coming to grief costs, and
(optionally) how it ducks - plus a ramp. Each name
declares its admission arithmetic as an SDK constant (the `experience_curve`
idiom: the contract names the feel, the consumer owns the numbers), so a track
is provable against the exact arc it will be played with before any art is
paid for. Scoring is runtime-owned: distance plus pickups, with nothing to
author.

v3 splits what v2's `collision_policy` had conflated. That one name carried
the avatar's torso box - which every press-window proof reads - *and* asserted
that a hazard ends the run, and the two are unrelated: the box is geometry
admission depends on, while what a contact costs is a consequence the package
chooses. So `collision_box` keeps the geometry under an honest name, and a
`[run.consequences]` table answers the separate question once per way of
coming to grief. `end_run_v1` survives there, as the consequence it always
was.

Admission is unchanged and stays exactly as strict. A gauge is forgiveness
laid over a fair track, never a licence to author an unfair one: every hazard
must still be provably avoidable at the base speed, whether or not surviving
it is possible.

The rule that decides where a number lives: it belongs in the SDK constant
table iff a REFUSAL depends on it; it stays consumer-owned iff only the FEEL
depends on it. The arc constants below shape offline refusals (gap spans,
hazard press windows, overhead fit), so they are declared here and published
into the runtime manifest; the difficulty ramp's pacing shapes only feel and
stays in the consumer.
