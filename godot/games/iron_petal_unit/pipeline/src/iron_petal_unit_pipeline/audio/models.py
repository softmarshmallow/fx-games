"""Authored runner audio: event bindings and portable effect realizations.

The runner owns when its nine semantic audio events occur. This contract owns
which named effect answers each event and how each effect is realized: the
provider-free oscillator sweep the web consumer synthesizes, a generated clip
the graph buys once from a text-to-sound route, or a spoken line - a *bark* -
the graph buys once from a text-to-speech route on a voice the game's catalog
declares. The event-to-effect bindings are the same in every case, so a cue
can change realization without remapping gameplay.

Eight of the events are consequences of player verbs and every package binds
all eight. The ninth, ``stage_start``, is an announcement - the frame the
stage-start moment opens, before the first run of a boot - and silence is a
legitimate announcement, so it is the one binding a package may leave out.
The contract also owns what the soundtrack does at the
run's edges - the interactive-music vocabulary of an action, a fade time, and
a fade curve on death and restart, and an optional duck under the hurt cue -
while the soundtrack catalog itself stays a separate member. Provider or model
identifiers never belong in this authored contract.
