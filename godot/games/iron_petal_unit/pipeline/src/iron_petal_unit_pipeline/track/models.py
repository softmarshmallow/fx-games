"""The runner's track contract: authored tiled segments over the shared side-view stage.

A track reuses the platformer map's view, continuity, digest-locked references,
and parallax vocabulary, and selects a closed ground-presentation mode: the
shared 47-mask atlas or one structural painting per segment. Both modes serve
AUTHORED occupancy chunks; neither owns geometry. The camera is the runner's
own: `auto_run_x_v1` advances on its own rather than following input.

Segments are the genre fact. Every chunk shares one grid height and one
`walk_surface_row`, and the SEAM RULE - every chunk's first and last columns
are bottom-supported with their surface exactly at `walk_surface_row` - is what
makes the track infinite: any chunk may follow any chunk in any order, so no
cross-chunk geometry check ever exists. Pits (bottom-row `0` runs) are legal
here; the platformer family's bottom-supported-escape-floor rule is exactly
the rule this family drops. Whether a pit is CLEARABLE is a cross-member fact
proved at package resolution against the gameplay contract's jump profile.
