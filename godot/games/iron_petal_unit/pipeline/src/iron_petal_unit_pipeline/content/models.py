"""The runner's avatar catalog: exactly one runtime actor, minimally obligated.

One avatar, and up to four bosses when the package fights any.

`player-content-v3` is deliberately not reused despite already knowing "run":
it requires `equipment` and `dialogue_art`, obligations of the platformer and
dialogue families that a runner avatar owes nobody. This catalog carries the
shared drawn-actor blocks (reference binding, motion playback) and the closed
runner motion set, and nothing else. One actor may be either one visible
character or one machine with its rider visibly aboard; in the latter case all
silhouette, proportion, collision, duck, and motion-rebase facts describe the
combined rider-and-machine figure. Obstacles and pickups reuse the platformer's
`prop-content-v2` and `item-content-v2` verbatim.
