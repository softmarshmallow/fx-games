"""The game-global voice catalog (``game-voices-v1``).

A voice is an externally-held identity - the audio twin of a digest-bound
visual reference: something the package binds by name, carries a rights
statement for, and never invents. A genre audio contract names a voice by its
catalog id and nothing else, so recasting a character is a catalog edit and a
provider's reference never appears beside gameplay data.

The catalog is game-global because every consumer of a voice - a runner's
run-start bark today, a visual novel's voiced lines later - reads the same
cast. Delivery settings (stability) are per line and live with the line;
the catalog owns who speaks, in which language, and on whose terms.
