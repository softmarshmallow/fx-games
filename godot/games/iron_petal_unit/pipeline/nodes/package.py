"""The runtime package the Godot host plays: every published file, at its runtime path.

The step reads the game's package again from its own files (so the manifest projects exactly
the closure the plan was made from), lays every published file out at the path the host
reads it from, republishes the authored references the manifest names, and writes
``manifest.json``. Its one output is the whole folder, delivered with
``--deliver package=<dir>/{key}``.
