`fx.toml` is the game-global source of truth for generated **screen FX**: the plates a game
slams over its screen at a *moment*, and the binding from each moment to the effect that
plays there. It is a root sibling of `ui.toml`. The industry's word for the family is
presentation, or UI motion; VFX in studio usage means particles and shaders, which will be
one member of this family, not the family. The document owns plates and bindings only. The
choreography — every duration, easing, and offset — is consumer-owned, because only the feel
depends on it and no refusal does.

The exact current identity is `game-fx-v2`. It contains one effect kind, `cut_in`, with two
generated plates and one choreography, and two served moments: `stage_start` and
`encounter_start`.

## Why two plates

A cut-in is motion: a rip sweeps in, the character slides in *behind* the rip's mask with
overshoot, the backdrop keeps moving, lettering lands, hold, tear away. Every verb is a
transform on a separate part, so the parts are materialized separately, split by **who
moves** rather than by who paints. The spike that settled this generated the whole
composition as one image too: it was the prettiest of the set and could only translate and
fade. Separating it afterwards is a segmentation problem, not a transform.

| part | owner | alpha | produced by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frame` — one paper cut-out, flat white fill, black ink rim | style-scoped, character-agnostic | binary | the image model, or a local procedural drawing |
| `portrait` — one die-cut close-up | actor-scoped, bound to the digest-locked references the actor uses or to the concept plate the run drew for it | soft edge admitted | the image model |
| backdrop, stripes, lettering | runtime | — | the consumer |
| placement — where the portrait sits inside the frame's opening | judged once per portrait | — | the tool-loop agent (below) |
| choreography | consumer | — | `godot/games/iron_petal_unit/gameplay/support/screen_fx/cut_in.gd` |

The frame plate does three jobs at runtime: its silhouette is the mask, drawn as-is it is
the white rim, filled black and offset it is the shadow. Drawn once more on top in multiply,
its ink rim stays over the face. Lettering is the manifest's display names, never a
generated string: the runtime supplies every string, which is what keeps localisation
possible.

## Effect kinds and moments

Both vocabularies are closed. **Effect kinds:** `cut_in` is served. `wipe` — one full-screen
plate whose published polygon sweeps the screen between two states, the transition the
platformer's portal and the visual novel's scene change want — is the reserved second kind;
`vignette` (the atlas taxonomy's `damage_vignette`) the third. Each kind is one plate set,
one gate, one polygon contract, one choreography table.

**Moments** are game-global and genre-blind in the document; which moments a genre emits is
checked where that genre resolves, so a package binding a moment its genre never plays is
refused offline as paid generation nobody would see.

| Moment | Emitted by | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stage_start` | runner, before the first run of a boot | served |
| `map_enter` | platformer, on a portal transition | reserved |
| `scene_enter` | visual novel and room, on entry | reserved |
| `fever_start` | runner, when the fever locomotion override lands | reserved |
| `run_ended` | runner | reserved |
| `encounter_start` | runner, when a boss arrives on its arena | served |

Each moment carries the two lines of lettering the cut-in draws, published in the manifest as
`title` and `subtitle`. They are display names the host already holds — a track name, a boss
name — and never a generated string: a cut-in announcing words a model invented would be the
one place in a package where what is on screen answers to nobody. The runner titles
`stage_start` with the track and `encounter_start` with the boss.

A moment is bound at most once. Every declared portrait must be played by some moment: dead
art is refused, the map-contract rule. A portrait prompt never states the subject's age —
the references carry it, and an age token on a face-filling close-up is exactly what the
provider's moderation refused in the spike — so the loader refuses one offline.

### Where a portrait's identity comes from

A portrait needs an identity, and the prompt is never it: the prompt carries the moment and
the mood, and prose alone would draw a different subject on every attempt. There are two
sources, and a portrait declaring neither is refused offline.

| source | field | identity is | used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| authored references | `reference_ids` | the digest-locked files the actor already uses | a character the package ships art for |
| a drawn subject | `subject` | the concept plate this same run draws | an actor the run generates — a boss |

`subject` is `{ kind = "actor_concept_v1", actor_id = "…" }`, and it is a **graph edge**, not
a description: the generate node depends on the node that draws that actor, the concept plate
arrives as image 1, and the plate's cache key is the concept's lineage, so redrawing the actor
redraws the plate that announces it. Without the edge a boss cut-in could only be *described*
in prose, and the machine on the plate would be a different machine from the one the player
then fights. The reviewer is shown the same concept as image 2 and judges identity against it
rather than against words.

Which ids are resolvable is the hosting genre's, exactly as the moment vocabulary is: the
runner resolves a boss id and refuses any other, and a genre that draws no actors refuses a
subject outright while the graph is being built. The two identity sources compose — a subject
portrait may still cite references for the print register it is drawn in.

## Layouts, alpha policies, admission

Both plates are `1536 × 1024`, generated with native alpha.

| Plate | Layout | Alpha policy | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frame` | `cut_in_frame_1536x1024_v1` | `transparent_exterior_opaque_body_v1` | coverage 0.15–0.75 of the canvas; binary alpha (soft share ≤ 8 %); exterior glow share ≤ 2 %; at most 8 pieces above the dust floor (0.5 % of the silhouette) and at most 12 specks below it; at most 12 holes; spans ≥ 60 % of the width; fill ≥ 55 % near-white; ink 3–45 % of the painted area |
| `portrait` | `cut_in_portrait_1536x1024_v1` | `transparent_exterior_v1` | coverage 0.30–0.95; exterior glow or wash share ≤ 3 %; one subject (largest shape ≥ 98 %) |

Each gate is the plate's judge, so a failing plate is drawn again, at most six takes,
rather than failing the run. Where the portrait's head bleeds off the
canvas is recorded as evidence, not refused, until repeats calibrate it. Canonicalization
clears the already-transparent exterior to alpha 0, and on a frame also erases the dust the
gate measured around, so the published plate is the authored shape and nothing else
(`pixel_rewrite: alpha_exterior_and_dust_clear_v1`). It never infers a silhouette.

The frame gate is deliberately topology-light, because **the rip's shape is authored**
(below) and what a consumer clips with is the plate's own alpha. Shards, a hole, an edge
that doubles back: those are shapes, not defects. What the gate still refuses is confetti —
too many drawn pieces to read as one graphic element — and a silhouette too narrow to carry
the screen. A speck below the dust floor is neither refused nor kept: every real generation
leaves one or two, and spending every take over three stray pixels would make the
shape slot unauthorable in practice, so dust is measured around here and erased in
canonicalization. A *spray* of dust is still a defect. Whether the silhouette is the shape its author asked for is a judgement, and it
belongs to the reviewer, which is told the authored shape.

The frame's validate step then traces the **mask polygon**: the silhouette at or above alpha
128, eroded by `mask_erode_px = 22` so the ink rim stays on top of what the mask reveals,
read as a top edge left to right and a bottom edge back, each simplified to at most half of
64 vertices, normalized to the canvas. That trace can only express a shape that is
single-valued per column, so the outline is checked against the silhouette it claims to
describe (IoU ≥ 0.90) and published as `null` when the two disagree. A missing outline is
honest; a wrong one is not, and nothing downstream would have caught it. The procedural
frame passes the same gate and publishes the same contract, so a consumer never learns which
producer it was handed.

### Authoring the shape

`[cut_in.frame]` carries two pieces of prose with two jobs. `prompt` is the rip's
**register** — paper, ink, how the tear reads — and `shape` is its **silhouette**. An
authored `shape` replaces the component's default sentence outright rather than arguing with
it inside one prompt. The prose around the slot is shape-neutral for the same reason: it asks
for paper, ink and emptiness and never for a *kind* of edge, so exactly one sentence in the
brief describes how the silhouette is cut. Keep the register that way too — an edge
instruction in `prompt` outvotes the shape slot, and the model follows the majority:

```toml
[cut_in.frame]
mode = "generated_v1"
prompt = "The cover's print-poster register: flat white paper stock, bold hand-inked black rim."
shape = "Three overlapping torn shards fanned across the canvas, the middle one widest."
```

Everything around the slot stays the component's: flat white fill, inked rim, nothing inside,
a transparent exterior, and enough width to read as a screen element. With no `shape`
authored, the default is one slightly tilted ragged strip edge to edge — the genre's
canonical form, and what every existing game gets. `procedural_v1` takes no prose at all and
refuses a `shape`; it draws a band.

Measured on real generations of Iron Petal's frame (`gpt-image-2`, the cover as the style
reference, the same brief with only the shape sentence swapped): an angular slashed shard and
a tapering diagonal both come back as one piece, and *"one wide tilted shard plus two thinner
detached slivers, one above and one below"* comes back as exactly three pieces at 0.83 / 0.09
/ 0.08 of the silhouette — a topology the family now carries end to end. Each of those
generations also left one to three stray pixels behind, which is what the dust floor is for.

## Placement: the agent decides, the pipeline renders

Where the portrait sits inside the frame's opening — its scale and its centre — is taste,
not truth. No formula owns it. The family hands the job to a **tool-loop agent**, FX's
bounded agent episode (`ctx.agent`, on the game's `agent.turn` route): a vision model given the portrait
plate, the frame plate, a starting composition, the opening's measured geometry, one tool
(`render_with_placement`, which draws the hold frame exactly as the game will), and a
budget of six looks. It renders, looks, adjusts, and ends by calling `submit`. What it
submits is *data*, never pixels:

```text
placement = { scale, x, y }   # scale: portrait display height ÷ frame canvas height
                              # (x, y): portrait canvas centre in frame-canvas units;
                              #         may lie outside 0..1
```

Admission (`admit_cut_in_placement`) is pixel-blind on purpose — finite numbers inside the
declared ranges, a rationale, and the sha256 of both plates the agent looked at, which must
be the plates the step read — so a placement judged over other plates is refused.
A budget spent without an admitted submit is a refused node, not a guess. The agent's
instructions carry the taste (eyes in the band's upper-middle, mouth inside, hair and
shoulders may bleed); the two former runtime constants are gone, and so is the reviewer's
job of policing them. The geometry it is handed is measured from the mask **raster**, not
from the published outline — centroid, coverage, and per-column spans with how much of each
column is open — so the numbers stay true for a shape no polygon describes.

One structured review per generated plate judges what the pixel gate cannot: style
coherence with the references and a torn-edge reading for the frame; identity match with the
references, the authored expression, and cropping for the portrait; text-freedom for both.
The reviewer sees the plate over a checkerboard beside the composed hold frame drawn through
the plate's own silhouette with the portrait at its admitted placement, which is exactly what
the game shows — the same clip the Godot view makes, so evidence and game cannot drift. A producer never accepts its own work: the placement agent and the reviewer are
two calls with two jobs.

## Manifest projection

```text
fx = null | {
  cut_in: null | {
    frame: { role, mode, layout, alpha_policy, canvas {width, height},
             mask_polygon null | [[x, y], ...], band_rect {x, y, width, height},
             mask_erode_px, asset },
    portraits: [ { portrait_id, role, layout, alpha_policy, canvas, alpha_rect,
                   placement {scale, x, y}, asset } ]
  },
  moments: [ { moment, effect, portrait_id, choreography } ]
}
```

The block is identical in every consumer's manifest, and the genre that plays a moment reads it
where its own contract is parsed — `godot/games/iron_petal_unit/gameplay/contract.gd` for the first host.
`mask_polygon` is a portable convenience for a consumer that clips by geometry and can accept an
approximation; it is `null` for a shape no single outline describes. The shape a consumer clips
with is the plate's alpha: Godot clips children to their parent's drawn alpha, so the plate *is*
the mask, and the outline is never read at all. `asset` paths are run artifacts; the plates and
their validation records are published like any other.

## Choreography

`tear_reveal_v1` is the served choreography. Its beats live in `godot/games/iron_petal_unit/gameplay/support/screen_fx/cut_in.gd` as a
pure function of elapsed milliseconds, so a fixed-step replay draws the same frame on the
same tick: the rip sweeps in over 180 ms and settles from 1.12× scale; the portrait slides in
from 30 % left with a back-ease overshoot between 100 and 400 ms and pushes in 4 % over the
hold; the banner lands between 300 and 480 ms; the game frame dims from 600 ms; the
choreography **releases** at 1600 ms, when the tear-away begins, and **finishes** at 1900 ms.
Release is the mark a consumer resumes its simulation on; finish is when the overlay is
gone.

## Host contracts

**Generation.** `demo_game_tools.steps.effects.add_cut_in_steps(frame_group, portrait_group,
nodes=…, fx=…, style_prompt=…, reference_path=…, subject_image=…)` writes the frame's
producer (a painting and its judge, or the procedural draw), the step that clears its
exterior and, for a generated frame, its review; then, per portrait, a painting and its
judge, the placement episode (`place`), the step that composes it in the frame, and its
review. The compose step reads the frame and the placement, so the portrait's reviewer
judges the real composition. The host supplies the groups to write into, the node module
that hosts the family's node types, the document, a prompt wrapper for its art direction,
and two accessors: an authored reference to a project path, and a drawn subject to its
picture. The runner hosts it in one call.

**Runtime.** A world carries one slice, `fx`, empty or the moment in play, and an event
queue it can emit into. The runner's `gameplay/systems/fx.gd` stamps the moment's start
from the step clock on the first held tick, evaluates the choreography
(`FamilyCutIn.frame`), drives the view, and emits `fx-released` once and `fx-finished` at
the end; it reads nothing else about the world. The genre's own loop decides what *held*
means: the runner holds an `intro` phase and leaves it on `fx-released`; the platformer
will hold its map-rebuild boundary. `HostCutInView`
(`godot/games/iron_petal_unit/scenes/common/cut_in_view.gd`) is the Godot view:
screen-space nodes positioned from the frame's numbers each tick; the interior —
backdrop, stripes, the portrait at its published `placement` with the choreography's
slide and push-in riding on top — composed inside the plate's own silhouette, because
Godot clips children to their parent's drawn alpha; the plate drawn once more in multiply
through `ink.gdshader` for the ink; and the lettering from the two strings the host
passes. The portrait's arithmetic is the same in PIL and in the view: centre at
`(x·W, y·H)`, height `scale·H`.

## Known limits of an authored shape

The rip's shape is authored; the rest of the family has not caught up with it, and this is
the honest list of where it still assumes a band. None is load-bearing for the default shape,
and each is cheap to fix when a game actually wants it.

| Limit | What happens today | The fix, when it is needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tear_reveal_v1` sweeps a horizontal strip in and away | a shape that is not wide and roughly horizontal reveals correctly but animates oddly | a second choreography, which is a new identity either way |
| the placement agent's instructions say *band* | prose slightly off for a shard cluster; the geometry it reads is already raster-true | reword the instructions — taste lives there, not in code |
| `procedural_v1` always draws a band | the free mode ignores an authored shape and refuses one offline | parameterize the draw, or leave it as the shape-free fallback it is |
| `mask_polygon` approximates within IoU 0.90 | a hole covering under ~10 % of the silhouette is smoothed over in the outline, and a sliver thinner than the 22 px erosion disappears from it entirely (the outline then describes the main piece, which is what it is checked against) | publish a multi-ring outline, or drop the outline for consumers that can clip with alpha |
| the frame gate is the frame's judge | a shape that fails a *material* check is drawn again, up to six takes, before the run fails | split material checks (redraw-worthy) from shape checks (author-worthy) if this ever costs real money |

## World-space sprites

A cut-in is one big picture the runtime animates. A world-space sprite is the opposite: a
small picture drawn many times a second at a fistful of pixels, and its whole problem is
still reading at that size. They share this document and the package's art direction, and
nothing else — the gates measure different things because the failures are different.

The family lives at `2d/fx/sprite/<name>.*` and has one member, `dust`. A package authors
it under `[sprite.dust]`: a `layout`, an `alpha_policy`, the references it is drawn from,
and a `prompt` that is the dust's *register* — what the puffs are made of and how they are
drawn. The prompt may not describe the sheet's layout, and a prompt that names a grid, a
quarter or a reading order is refused offline, before any spend. This is the same rule the
frame's `shape` slot learned the hard way: the model follows whichever sentence sits nearest
the shape, so two sentences describing the same thing is a coin toss, not a direction.

`fx_dust_atlas_1024x1024_v1` is one transparent plate holding four separate clouds, read
left to right then top to bottom, and that reading order *is* the binding: the first cell
draws a landing, the second a takeoff, the third a stride, the fourth a slide. A package
that wants a different assignment authors a different layout; it does not reorder anything.

The sheet is not a strip and nothing assumes a rigid grid, because a generated sheet never
lands on one. The gate finds the clouds the way the cut-in gate finds pieces — connected
regions of painted alpha — and assigns each to a kind by the quarter its *centroid* sits in,
so a cloud that leans past a midline still belongs to the quarter it was drawn in. It then
refuses what a consumer could not use: a sheet that is not exactly four clouds, two clouds
sharing a quarter, a cloud thinner than 96 px on its short side, and a cloud filling under
0.35 of its own bounding box. That last one is the whole lesson of the spike as a number —
a shape can have the bounding box of a cloud and still be trailing wisps, and wisps are what
turn into grey speckle at 40 px. There is deliberately no rule about the gap between clouds:
two nearer than one mask block are a single connected piece, so the count already says so.

Canonicalization does three things and publishes what it measured. It clears the exterior to
alpha 0; it **lifts a body at alpha 250 or above to 255**, because the provider's transparent
output tops out at 254 and a consumer compositing that over a lit background shows a hairline
of it through what was drawn as solid paint; and it erases specks under 1 % of the plate,
which the gate measured around and refuses only as a spray of more than 16. The cells are
measured on the canonical plate, not the raw one — a speck erased after measuring would leave
a published rectangle around nothing.

There is no review node. What a reviewer judges on a cut-in is a face and a composition;
what makes dust right is whether four solid clouds came back separable, and the gate measures
exactly that, offline, for nothing. A second sprite family that needs taste rather than
measurement brings its own reviewer.

The manifest publishes the atlas and its cells; a consumer registers those rectangles as
sub-frames and never looks at the pixels to find them, exactly as it never re-derives a
motion strip's frames. A runner with no published atlas draws its dust procedurally instead,
so dust never depends on a provider having been paid — see
[runner.md](runner.md) for what the runtime does with either.

## Growing the vocabulary

A second effect kind, a second choreography, or a new moment is a new identity and a dropped
run set, never an optional field on the shapes above. A second world-space sprite (a slash,
a spark, a burst) joins `sprite` as a sibling of `dust` under its own layout, when it has a
caller.
