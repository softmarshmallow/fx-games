# Authored game sound effects

> **Scope: game consumers.** This document describes the formats used by these Godot games.
> The public asset SDK and new games do not require this authoring format.

> **Contract maturity: exact-current prepared-package contract.**

A genre's audio contract binds its semantic events to named effects, says
how each effect is realized, and says what the soundtrack does at the run's
edges. Today the runner member owns one, `runner/audio.toml`
with the exact identity `runner-audio-v4`. An effect is realized as a
provider-free `oscillator_sweep_v1` the consumer synthesizes, as a
`generated_clip_v1` the execution graph buys once from a text-to-sound-effect
route and the consumer plays back, or as a `spoken_line_v1` - a bark - the
graph buys once from a text-to-speech route on a voice the game's catalog
casts; that third kind has its own page, [game-voice.md](voices.md). The
event bindings are the same in every case, so a cue can change realization
without remapping gameplay. Eight events are consequences of player verbs and
every package binds all eight; the ninth, `stage_start`, is an announcement
and may be left silent.

This page is the authoring and execution contract for the generated kind. The
measured behaviour of the route it is bought from - what it can and cannot be
asked for - is the model boundary in
[spec/model-eleven-text-to-sound-v2.md](../../../../docs/spec/model-eleven-text-to-sound-v2.md).
**Read that first.** The pipeline does not compensate for the model: the prompt
you write is the prompt it hears.

## Ownership

| Owner | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `runner/audio.toml` | Event-to-effect bindings, each effect's realization, for a generated clip the prompt, exact duration, prompt influence, and playback mix, and the music transitions on death, restart, and hurt |
| `game.toml` | Exact audio source path |
| Runtime (the Godot host, `scenes/audio/`) | When events fire, audio playback lifecycle, decoding, applying the authored gain and rate lift, and performing the music transitions on the soundtrack element |
| The game's FX build | Route selection (`fx.yaml`), and per clip one generate step, its judge and one record step; FX keeps the run record and cache identity |
| Model doc | Which cues the route serves, how to word them, and why some are out of reach |

The eight events are takeoff, air jump, land, slide, hazard cleared, collect,
hurt (the frame a survivable vitals drain connects; silent in a one-hit-kill
package), and death. Every event binds to a declared effect and every declared
effect is bound; the loader refuses anything else before any spend. A generated clip's fields:

| Field | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | 1–450 characters, already trimmed | Sent to the provider verbatim. No direction, medium line, or originality clause is added. |
| `duration_seconds` | 0.5–30, required | The window the model fills. It is the repetition control: half a second is one event, two seconds is a cycle. Letting the model choose is refused because it overshoots. |
| `prompt_influence` | 0–1, optional | Omitted means the provider default. Unmeasured in this repository; do not assume a direction. |
| `gain` | (0, 1] | Playback gain in the consumer. |
| `strength_pitch_multiplier` | 0–2 | Playback rate becomes `1 + strength × value`, so a chained collect can rise the way the oscillator's does. |

`gain` and `strength_pitch_multiplier` are mixing, not generation. They travel
in the manifest and are **not** part of the clip's cache identity, so rebalancing
a set after listening is a free re-plan, never a redraw. Anything under half a
second stays an oscillator: the route cannot go shorter and trimming is
post-processing.

## Choosing a take

The route has no seed and a person picks the winner, so a generated clip is
chosen the way a spoken line is (see [game-voice.md](voices.md) for the full
account). The build draws take 1;
`uv run python -m grida.fx reroll <run> "sounds.<effect_id>.generate"` draws the
next take of that one clip, and `uv run python -m grida.fx pick` keeps one. The
pick is written to `pipeline/iron-petal-unit.takes.yaml` beside the builder,
which every run reads; the authored `take` field stays 1, and the build refuses another with a
notice naming that file. `[effects.realization.pinned]` instead commits a
reviewed take into the package by digest, sidecar and all, republished through
the same gates with no provider call:

```toml
[effects.realization]
kind = "generated_clip_v1"
prompt = "hard hit on sheet metal"
duration_seconds = 0.5
gain = 0.8
strength_pitch_multiplier = 0.0

[effects.realization.pinned]
source = "runner/audio/hull_clank.mp3"
source_sha256 = "<sha256 of the mp3>"
provenance_source = "runner/audio/hull_clank.mp3.meta.json"
provenance_sha256 = "<sha256 of the sidecar>"
rights_status = "unreviewed"
```

## Music transitions

What the soundtrack does when the run ends is authored, not assumed, and it is
authored in the vocabulary interactive-music middleware (Wwise, FMOD) already
uses. Three things fire on one game event and are independent of each other:

| Term | Meaning | In this contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action | What the playing music does: stop, pause, resume, play, or nothing. Each carries a fade time and a fade curve; a zero fade is the arcade hard cut. | `[music.death]`, `[music.restart]` |
| Stinger | A short one-shot layered *over* the music at the event, the game-over jingle. Posted beside the action, never instead of it. | The effect bound to `death` (and `hurt`) |
| Ducking | The music dips under a sound effect, holds, and recovers. | `[music.hurt]`, optional |

So a runner's game over is both at once: the death stinger plays immediately
and the music fades out underneath it. The fields:

| Table | Field | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `music.death` | `action` | `stop`, `pause`, `continue` | `stop` ends the track; `pause` holds its position; `continue` leaves the music alone |
| | `fade_seconds` | 0–10 | Time to reach silence. Zero applies at once. |
| | `curve` | `linear`, `exponential` | As Web Audio defines them: `exponential` interpolates gain geometrically to a near-zero floor, the equal-loudness feel of a middleware exp/log curve |
| `music.restart` | `action` | `play`, `resume`, `continue` | Must pair with death: `stop → play` (the next shuffled track from the top), `pause → resume`, `continue → continue`. Any other pair is refused at load. |
| | `fade_seconds`, `curve` | as above | The fade-in |
| `music.hurt` (optional) | `duck_gain` | (0, 1) | The music's gain factor while ducked |
| | `fade_seconds`, `hold_seconds`, `recovery_seconds` | 0–10 each | Dip, hold, recover |
| | `curve` | as above | Applied to the dip and the recovery |

Every value here is consumer mixing, like `gain` on a clip: no cache identity
includes it, so tuning after listening is a re-plan and never a redraw. The
table is required and inert in a package with no soundtrack member. A
transition arriving during another cancels it, so a restart pressed mid-fade
starts the next track cleanly. Beat-synced transitions and transition segments
are excluded: the runner's seam rule forbids beat sync. A tape-stop is not
middleware vocabulary and the media element cannot ramp its rate to zero, so
it is not offered either.

## What is checked, and what is not

The only automated verdicts are the ones a decoder can state about the bytes.
Each refuses rather than repairs. The clip's judge (`admit`) refuses a draw and it is
drawn again, at most six takes; FX's engine stays the one retry owner of each call.

| Gate | Where | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Byte floor | judge, redrawn | Under 2 KiB is a truncated container |
| Dead level | judge, redrawn | Peak below −40 dBFS was heard as silence |
| Clipping | judge, redrawn | Peak at or above −0.1 dBFS was clipped by the model |
| Exact duration | `record` step, which fails | More than 0.15 s from the authored duration |

Level is measured, recorded as `peak_dbfs` in the artifact's provenance and its
validation record, and never changed. **No normalization, no trimming, no
concatenation.** That is a repository rule and the spike that produced the model
doc showed why: normalizing to a fixed peak caused the harshness it was meant to
prevent.

Whether the clip *sounds like* its cue is a listening verdict. The validation
record carries `listening_verdict: "not_performed"` until a person makes it.

## Execution

For each generated effect the runner's build writes:

```text
sounds.<effect_id>.generate   (fx/sound.generate@1 on the sound.generate route)
sounds.<effect_id>.admit      (judge: byte floor, level, clipping; a refusal is drawn again)
sounds.<effect_id>.record     (local: ffprobe duration, ffmpeg level)
  -> package
```

The generate step's card shows the authored prompt exactly. Its identity is the
prompt, duration, loop flag and prompt influence on its route; it reads nothing else
of the package, so an unrelated authored edit does not re-bill a clip. Oscillator
effects add no steps. The route is the game's `fx.yaml` binding for `sound.generate`,
`eleven_text_to_sound_v2@elevenlabs`. A live run without `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` refuses
each clip's call before it is sent, for nothing, and that step fails;
`uv run python -m grida.fx doctor`, from the game's folder, names a missing key before a
run.

The manifest publishes what the consumer plays - `clip`, `duration_seconds`,
`gain`, `strength_pitch_multiplier` - and not what bought it. The prompt lives
in the run's record.

## Auditioning a prompt

Write the wording into `audio.toml` and run the build: every other step comes
back from the call cache, so only the changed clip is drawn and billed.

```sh
cd godot/games/iron_petal_unit
uv run python -m grida.fx run pipeline/workflow.py:build --arg package=inputs --live --max-usd 2
uv run python -m grida.fx start --open
```

The clip's step plays in the dashboard after the same admission a build applies.
Reroll it for another take, or reword it and run again.

## Validation

```sh
uv run --group games demo-games package validate --input godot/games/iron_petal_unit/inputs
(cd godot/games/iron_petal_unit && uv run python -m grida.fx plan pipeline/workflow.py:build --arg package=inputs)
```

Contract validity proves the closure and the plan, not the sound. Generated
audio needs a separate listening review before any quality or publication claim.

See [Authored game soundtracks](../../_shared/docs/soundtrack.md) for the music path this one
mirrors, and [the runner genre](runner.md) for the member that owns
the contract.
