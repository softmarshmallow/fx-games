"""Climbable atlas layout, request sizing, and per-role admission envelopes.

One provider image carries every climbable a map declares. Layout is expressed in world tiles and
converted to pixels exactly once, so it survives a change of supersample factor or runtime tile
size. The request size must satisfy the provider's own limits, which is what bounds how many
variants can share a sheet.

A ladder carries crosswise rungs; a rope is a continuous strand. Their silhouettes differ by
roughly a factor of four, so each role is admitted against its own aspect envelope. The role is
authored in ``maps/<map_id>.toml`` and never inferred from pixels.
