"""The examples Bellweather made, published through the product's public example contract.

Four of Bellweather's outputs are shown as examples made by this game: its parallax
backgrounds, its terrain tiles, its UI kit and its player's animation set. Each needs the
whole game package to make, so none is a product workflow. The game owns everything about
them: ``godot/games/bellweather/examples.toml`` declares each one (title, promise, run
command, steps over its node ids, the runs it was made from, and the pins of its frozen
export), ``examples/<id>/page.mdx`` holds its prose, and the importers in this package turn
the runs into ``workflow-example-v1`` documents with ``stage_gen.examples``.

``demo-games example export bellweather`` writes them into the local example store. The
dependency runs from the game to the product: the product lists whatever a game wrote into
the store and never names a game.
