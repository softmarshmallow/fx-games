"""The platformer genre member: resolution and the cross-contract rules.

Resolution turns the member's authored sources into typed contracts through
the package capture, locking every map, content and UI reference by digest,
then proves the member offline: one game_id everywhere, maps that gameplay
covers and can reach, portals that spawns and transitions resolve, the motion
states and artwork the gameplay obliges, and every cross-reference a runtime
would otherwise discover missing. :class:`ResolvedGamePackage` is the
platformer recipe's view of a resolved package with the member's contracts as
named fields.
