"""A map's ground: the shared 47-mask atlas or painted segments, and the atlas's evidence.

The atlas family (``demo_game_tools.steps.terrain_atlas``) paints and assembles the material
sheet; the painted family (``demo_game_tools.steps.painted_terrain``) paints one segment per
cut of the occupancy. The atlas's evidence is the canonical sheet composed through the map's
generated occupancy, which is what a reviewer reads the ground from.
