"""The package's bindings, and the runtime folder the Godot host plays.

Both steps read the game's package again from its own files. The bindings step proves every
gameplay and scenario reference resolves; the package step lays every published file out at
its runtime path and assembles ``manifest.json`` over exactly the closure the manifest binds,
so the delivered folder is the one ``verify_prepared_runtime`` accepts.
