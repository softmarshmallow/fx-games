"""Generated paintover templates.

The terrain atlas proved that a model will respect a lattice it can see: hand it
a plate ruled with cyan guides and magenta cells, tell it to paint inside them,
and the cells come back separable by measurement instead of by trust. The 12x4
terrain template is locked to the 47-mask tile topology, so this spike draws its
own N x M plate under the same colour contract and asks the same question of a
flame cycle.

Whether that generalises from tile masks to animation frames is one of the four
things this spike is meant to find out.
