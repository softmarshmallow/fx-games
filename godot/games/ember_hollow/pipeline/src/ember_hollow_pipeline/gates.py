"""Deterministic gates. Every threshold here is refusal-bearing.

The division of labour is the repository's usual one: a gate here refuses what
can be measured, and a judge is asked only what cannot be. So this file refuses
opaque returns, cropped canvases, merged strip cells, vignetted ground, hard-cut
decals and a flame cycle that does not close; it says nothing about whether the
art is any good, and nothing about pictorial pitch, which no measurement of a
single flat picture can recover.

Two gates carry findings rather than refusals. ``floor_plate_suspected`` is
advisory because a low wide base is sometimes the object (a firepit's stone
ring) and sometimes the defect (a tree standing on a painted disc of soil), and
only a reviewer can tell which. The flame-cycle closure gate refuses, but its
recorded fallback is ping-pong playback rather than a failed run.

Pure PIL plus the repository's own media helpers. No numpy.
