"""Exact-current authored contract for the game shell: the screens around the game.

``shell.toml`` is a root sibling of ``ui.toml`` and ``fx.toml``. It owns the surfaces a
player meets before and between play — the opening cinematic, the title screen, the
loading screen — and nothing else. Its neighbours own the parts it composes with:
``ui.toml`` owns the panels and buttons a title screen's controls are drawn from, and
``fx.toml`` owns the plate that wipes one screen into the next. One owner per concept.

The document is genre-blind. Which screens a genre can actually show is checked where
that genre resolves, so a package declaring a screen its runtime never enters is refused
offline, before any spend — the same seam the screen-FX moment vocabulary already uses.

Three rules in here are worth reading before the code, because each is a decision rather
than a shape:

**Text is composited, never drawn.** Every string on a shell screen — the game's name,
a shot's card, a loading tip, a button's label — is authored here as text and set by the
host in the package's declared typeface. No prompt may ask for lettering, and one that
does is refused offline. This is not a guess about what image models can spell: every UI
role in this repository declares ``text_free``, and every package's style contract
already forbids "text pseudo-text logos signatures or watermarks". A shell that broke
that rule would be the one place in a package where what is on screen answers to nobody,
and it would take localisation with it.

**A typeface is an input, not a host asset.** A package that composites any text
declares the face it is set in, digest-bound with its licence, and the run publishes it.
See ``docs/decisions/0063-a-typeface-is-a-package-input.md``; without it a title is set
in whatever font the player's machine happens to have.

**A shot's plate is a still or a clip, and that is the only difference.** The opening is
a shot list with moves, durations, cards and transitions. Making a shot a video changes
one field and nothing else, so the cheap mode is not a prototype of the expensive one —
it is the same contract with a different plate.
