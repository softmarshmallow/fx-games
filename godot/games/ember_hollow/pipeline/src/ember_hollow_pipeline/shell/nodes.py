"""The shell's roles: every plate and shot a document declares, their briefs and records.

Every genre that shows a title screen draws the same things (a picture, a mark, a
picture with a strip kept quiet at the bottom, a few shots of an opening), and the
geometry, the gate and the review question do not know which genre asked. A **role** is
one plate or shot the document declared; adding a screen is a fan-out over
``document_plate_roles`` and ``document_clip_roles``, not new code. A build reads its
briefs, refs and review questions from here, and the manifest its block.
