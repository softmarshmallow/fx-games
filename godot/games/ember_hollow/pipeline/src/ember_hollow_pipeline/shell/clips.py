"""The shell's own gate on a generated clip, over the modality's objective one.

``components.video_clip`` answers what is true of any clip: one picture stream, the
codec asked for, the length asked for, 16:9, and — the one that matters — that it
moves. This module answers the two questions only the shell can ask.

**Does it fill the screen the layout declares.** A clip stands where a still would, so
its canvas is the clip layout's, and the aspect check is what lets a card band published
against the still canvas land in the same place over it.

**Does it end where it said it would.** ``ending = "match_title"`` is the only ending
that is a claim about the picture rather than about presentation: it says the cinematic
finishes on the screen the player is about to be looking at. That is measurable, so it
is measured — the last frame against the title's own far backdrop, both reduced to a
coarse signature so a camera move, a grade, or the Theora re-encode all still read as
the same picture.

Measured on the shell spike, over the published `.ogv` rather than the response:

    the same picture through a Theora round trip     0.30
    the same picture pushed in 10%                   9.15
    the same picture at 0.92 brightness              9.70
    ------------------------------------------- the ceiling, 12.0
    the closest pair of genuinely different plates  31.47
    this package's last shot against its title      59.62

Two clean populations with a 3.5x gap, and the ceiling sits in it.
