"""Authored oblique-survival package: the frozen contracts the graph reads.

Everything the graph and the manifest need about the authored intent is shaped
here and nowhere else, so a prompt change is a source change and lands in the
node's input digest. Magnitudes stay in player-height units all the way through
this module; the conversion to meters happens once, in ``manifest.py``.

Reading, validating and digesting the authored files is
``survival_request.py``'s job; this module holds only what a validated package
is. ``ObliqueSurvivalSource`` is the root document's pydantic contract, which is
where the authored identity ``oblique-survival-package-v2`` is declared, and
``WORLD_KIND`` is ``world.toml``'s.
