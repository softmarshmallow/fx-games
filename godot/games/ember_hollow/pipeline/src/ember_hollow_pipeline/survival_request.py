"""Read one authored oblique-survival package: validate, freeze, digest.

The loader is the recipe's ``_resolve`` target. It touches no provider: every
refusal here happens offline, before a run directory exists and before a cent
is spent. Each authored file lands in the digest ledger under its own name, and
the ledger's fixed-order digest is the package's identity -- so an edit to any
authored byte moves the source lock, and nothing else silently drifts.

An adopted take may be declared two ways. A bare path is read and digested from
disk, as it always was. An inline table ``{ path, sha256 }`` declares the
digest instead: that digest enters the ledger exactly as the file's would, the
file is verified against it when it is present, and its absence is allowed and
recorded so that planning works from the committed text alone while the adopt
node refuses at execution.
