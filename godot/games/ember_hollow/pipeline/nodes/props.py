"""A prop's ground anchor, placed by an agent that looks at its own proposals.

The agent is handed the baseline sprite and a tool that redraws it standing on a one-metre
ground grid at the scene camera's pitch, with its proposed anchor cross and footprint
ellipse; it adjusts until the ellipse sits under the object, picks a motion hint, and
submits. A submission outside the painted silhouette or above its lower third is handed
back as the tool's answer and the episode goes on.
