# Godot architecture

The [charter](../CHARTER.md) defines this maintained example project's scope.
FX Games owns asset generation; this project owns the playable consumers and
their runtime integration. Neither side requires one universal gameplay schema.

## Runtime dependencies

| Owner | Dependencies and responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `content_io` | No other addon; accepts explicit roots, references and optional source digests. |
| [`movie_sprite_actor`](../packages/movie_sprite_actor/README.md) | Declares only `content_io`; admits registered-face atlas descriptors, advances body frames, composites independent facial states and owns resource lifecycle. No Scenario or game dependency. |
| [`progression`](../packages/progression/README.md) | No other addon. Validates a game's reward design (items, curves, measurements, tables, sources, mails), keeps one ledger document (balances, tracks, records, entries, mail) and offers optional presenters. Knows no game noun: measurements, names and the clock come from the consumer. |
| `scenario_runtime` | Owns compiler, admission, Session progression/clocks, bindings and optional presenters. Declares `game_presentation` and `content_io`; pure execution has no scene/media dependency. |
| `sideview_rendering` | No game manifest; accepts source images/data, dimensions, anchors and presentation values. Image baking is separate from pure arithmetic. |
| `game_presentation` | Declares `content_io` for the existing local-content facade. Controllers retain their separate time, geometry and lifecycle contracts. |
| Private `demo_support` | Actual shared game implementation. Run-directory adapters use `content_io`; game-specific parsing and scene composition stay outside it. |
| Private scene navigation | Shared replacement/checkpoint lifecycle; games supply routes, scene preparation and opaque saved state. |

Games select packages. Afterlight, Command Link, the VN starter and The Grain's
“The way in” author v3 Scenario content. Bellweather and The Grain's other scenes
retain v2 prepared content through the compatibility adapter into the same Session
executor. Games own invocation,
input, world/camera policy, assets and saves. Bellweather and Iron Petal Unit use
side-view rendering. Afterlight and Command Link share private navigation while
keeping their own UI and checkpoint policy. Afterlight Lab consumes Movie Sprite Actor
through its public API; blink cadence, speaking mouth cycles, audio and diagnostic UI
stay with the host. Its standalone synthetic consumer requires neither game content
nor Scenario.

[Scenario's directory preview](../packages/scenario_runtime/docs/layout.md) expands
its standalone authoring distribution, native sessions, game-installed capability
bindings, optional presenters and data-package tooling. A catalog can introduce a
new preset over installed mechanisms; adding an algorithm requires installed code.
No narrative content owns a game or discovers arbitrary scene objects.

The four prepared-run games own their options in their scene code. Shared token
parsing owns syntax only. Ember Hollow loads mask images in a scene adapter and
passes decoded plates into simulation sampling. Its world construction still
receives game manifest/layout data through its existing run object; that remaining
coupling is explicitly tracked by the boundary tests.

## Source, inputs and evidence

Each game owns its authored inputs, preparation entry points, runtime bindings,
gameplay and prepared-content interpretation. Existing TOML remains supported by
its consuming reader. Playing, replaying and checking existing media never trigger
generation. Separate preparation tools consume the asset product.

Addon development links point to one maintained payload. Portable assembly copies
real source and declared dependencies, retains source UIDs and licenses, verifies
hashes and publishes a completed tree atomically. The game packager currently owns
the four prepared-run games; the Scenario assembler owns the VN starter.
Prepared media remains a separate input with its existing rights and provenance.

Mechanism tests belong to packages; game integration tests remain with games.
The [verification coordinator](verification.md) accounts for all maintained owners
and distinguishes offline checks, prepared-media checks and native-render/audio
checks. A deferred prerequisite is visible and is never counted as a pass.

Python preparation ownership is split into optional distributions. The
[dependency inventory](python-dependencies.md) distinguishes supported asset APIs
from the remaining private imports and their follow-up decisions. The collection
CLI dispatches lazily to game-owned operations; it generates nothing, and asset builds
run on Grida FX from each game's folder. Shared graph
document formatting still uses explicit repository tooling. The Scenario
compiler tests live beside its independent distribution; game production metadata
tests live under shared game Python support. Some other game Python tests and
snapshots remain under root test infrastructure and can move
with their owners without changing the product contract.

## Evolution

Private reuse does not automatically become a package. A package needs an
independently useful contract, declared dependencies, checks and a usable source
distribution. Conversely, a game-specific option or convention does not become
shared policy merely because it once lived in a shared file.

The [organization review](organization-review.md) records the extraction rationale;
the [roadmap](roadmap.md) tracks remaining reviews. Historical presentation records
remain evidence of their original implementation, not instructions about today's
directory tree. No release or stable API promotion follows from a source move.
