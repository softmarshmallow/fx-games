"""The identity table: every persisted identity string, read from the one place that owns it.

A persisted identity is a ``kind`` or ``mode`` word a document carries so that a reader
can refuse what it does not understand: the authored documents, the documents the
pipeline generates, the runtime manifests, the execution graphs, the mode words inside
documents, the cache namespaces, and the audio realization kinds. Each is declared once
in the code, on a pydantic ``Literal`` field or a module constant; this table names that
place and reads the value from it, so the docs can derive from the code instead of
asserting version strings by hand (contract rule C-R5 in ``docs/game-contract.md``).

What is *not* here: a node's ``contract_version``. That is a cache key, not an identity
(C-R1), and the cache-key goldens under ``tests/unit/games`` are its evidence. The
per-port ``kind`` labels inside an execution graph are graph vocabulary and stay with
their recipe.

Two families carry two live versions under one name, recorded rather than hidden:
``dialogue-scene`` is both the authored document (v5) and the recipe version (v8) the
plan and bundle stamp; ``scenario-program`` is the scenario component's program (v2)
and, at v1, a port label in the dialogue graph. Renaming either is a persisted change
and waits for the bump that needs it.
