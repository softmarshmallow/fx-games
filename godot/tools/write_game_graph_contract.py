"""Check or rewrite maintained game graph snapshots.

These executable contracts belong to the game-owned builders. New asset
pipelines do not inherit their gameplay stages or fixture requirements. A game
built on FX pins the plan of its builder over its own package: every planned
step instance (later takes included) and what each reads.
