# Game Consumer Design

This skill maintains authored inputs for named games under `godot/games/`.
New asset pipelines use [asset-pipeline](../asset-pipeline/SKILL.md). Each game
owns its GDScript, scenes, preparation and input format. Preserve existing readers
without making their TOML a universal game language.

Read the repository [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md), the
[game ownership instructions](../../../godot/games/AGENTS.md), and the selected
game's README. Existing prepared games keep inputs under their own `inputs/` directory;
Bellweather has separate `default/` and `waves/` closures. For idea exploration
or cover selection, use [game-concept-studio](../../../skills/game-concept-studio/SKILL.md).

## Read the contract

Use these as the source of truth:

1. [Game package](../../../godot/games/_shared/docs/game-package.md)
2. [Game contract](../../../godot/games/_shared/docs/game-contract.md)
3. [Map generation contract](../../../godot/games/bellweather/docs/map-generation-contract.md)
4. [Asset contracts](../../../docs/spec/asset-contracts.md)
5. [Scenario invocation contract](../../../godot/packages/scenario_runtime/docs/contract.md)
6. [Soundtrack contract](../../../godot/games/_shared/docs/soundtrack.md)
7. [The host contract](../../../godot/games/_shared/docs/formats/host-contract.md), for what a
   named gameplay choice actually becomes once a host runs it

Select the game and its input closure explicitly. There is no repository-wide
selected game. The contracts below describe existing readers; apply only the
ones used by the game being edited.

## Keep ownership clear

- `game.toml`: identity, visual direction, and package membership by exact
  source path.
- `gameplay.toml`: map use, transitions, spawns, population, combat, loot,
  interactions, and map audio.
- `maps/<map_id>.toml`: visual generation of one environment only: camera,
  movement, ground, layers, references, and their prompts.
- `content/*.toml`: asset identities and generation direction. These carry no
  gameplay *numbers* and no placement, but they are not free of gameplay: a few
  fields are closed names the package validator holds against `gameplay.toml`,
  and `player.equipment` is the one to watch. See below.
- `scenarios/*.toml` and `scenarios/*.scenario`: supported v2 narrative inputs;
  admission checks bounded reachability, not termination on every possible path.
- `soundtrack.toml`: music identities and generation direction.

Use stable `lower_snake_case` IDs. Keep every cross-reference explicit.

## Current Scenario content

Afterlight, Command Link and the VN starter keep current source, catalog and
compiled artifacts under their own `narrative/` directories. Installed capability
schemas, resource bindings and game-specific behavior belong to the player, not
the downloadable content. The game invokes Scenario and grants its channels,
objects and capabilities. It retains gameplay, input policy, simulation and saves.

Use the independent `scenario-authoring` check/compile commands for new v3 content;
see [authoring](../../../godot/packages/scenario_runtime/docs/authoring.md). Update
source, compiled program, source map and owned freshness tests together. Content
may select typed installed capabilities and presets. Do not embed code or create
story-ID callbacks that become another progression engine. Existing v2 inputs
retain their supported readers and compile through the compatibility adapter.

## The character and the kit are one decision

`gameplay.toml`'s `[combat] weapon_class` says how the character fights;
`content/player.toml`'s `equipment` says what they are drawn carrying. They are
one fact authored in two files, so for a combat-enabled package the validator
refuses the pairings that cannot both be true - a `hand_weapon_v1` figure cannot
fight as `ranged_dps_v1`, and a `thrown_kit_v1` figure cannot swing.

Decide these together, and decide them before the cover, because the cover is
the identity source every later strip is generated from. A cover showing a sword
commits the package to melee; changing your mind afterwards means re-selecting
the cover and re-rendering the whole player domain, not editing one line.

The equipment name is only the *class* of thing. The player `prompt` still names
the specific object, and the game's graph supplies the structural direction - that it
appears in every frame, or that it is never drawn at all. Do not repeat the
structural direction in the prose; do name the object.

`weapon_class = "ranged_dps_v1"` additionally requires a `projectile_id`
resolving into `content/projectiles.toml`, and a melee class must not name one.

## Prepare map references first

The main cover or character concept is art-direction evidence, not a map input.
Before authoring a map, create and review one or more dedicated,
environment-only scene concepts for that map. They may be informed by the
cover, but must not include the player, NPCs, mobs, UI, or text.

Only those dedicated scene images may appear in the map's `[[references]]`.
Each layer and ground prompt must identify what to derive or separate from its
chosen reference. Different layers may use different scene references. Obtain
authorization before any billable image generation, then record exact hashes
and inline origin/rights basis in the authored contract and bind semantic review
to the accepted bytes. Prepared inputs do not need `.meta.json`,
`.source.meta.json`, or `.LICENSE.md` sidecars.

If the map loops, compose its scene references with looping in mind instead of
blindly passing a general concept image. Give each intended depth band compatible
left/right boundary conditions, keep unique landmarks away from the edges, and
use quiet recurring motifs at both sides. The reference only communicates
composition; generated layers still require their own seamlessness validation.

## Review and close the package

Review the authored package as a game design, not only as valid TOML: check that
the content supports the intended gameplay, every relationship has one clear
owner, and each visual reference is suitable for its exact generation role.
Read the player prompt against the declared `equipment` and against the pinned
cover: the validator compares two closed names and cannot read prose, so prose
that contradicts the declaration passes closure and fails in the pixels.
Record the required independent semantic review for accepted generated media.

Validate an existing prepared package explicitly from the repository root:

```sh
uv run --group games python godot/tools/validate_game_package.py --input godot/games/bellweather/inputs/default
```

It verifies TOML parsing, confined paths, exact path membership, the authored
evidence and reference image digests, resolvable references, and orphaned
entries. Before serving a committed canonical demo, also run it with
`--require-committed`. Report reader and document mismatches as demo-local maintenance issues. Existing
TOML belongs to its game and is not required for new asset workflows. Stop at a complete authored input package: do not implement
the pipeline or claim that the game has been generated.
